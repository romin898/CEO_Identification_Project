John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Thank you, Carl. In our first quarter, Maxim generated $130 million in cash and we used $69 million to purchase two million shares and
then another $39 million to purchase equipment. This quarter and going forward, we are improving manufacturing costs and reducing
below the line spending and as a result, we will continue to show improved financial ratios.
This is coming about as a result of increased production efficiencies, yield improvements, controlling costs, reducing hiring, and we have
realigned moderately our sales and applications organization to accommodate a changing customer list which was brought about by the
reduction of significance of certain customers and actually more than a few that served primarily the telecommunications and the
dot-com markets. We believe this realignment will put us in very, very focused situation relative to recognizing who and where our future
revenues will result. Our objective, as I mentioned in our last conference call, it was achieve below the line spending levels of  percent
or less. But this will require some help from continued revenue growth, although you will see as you can see this quarter and next, we
have made significant progress. Our gross margins should continue to increase slightly as manufacturing and yield improvements kick in,
in Q2 and beyond. In Q1, operating income increased by two percent over Q4 levels to  percent of sales. In this quarter, we announced
 new products, up from  introduced in Q4, and  introduced in Q3. And although this is a  percent increase in new products
comparing Q1 to Q4, it was a  percent increase from the Q4 levels relative to engineering man months of engineering that were
introduced and we explained and discussed that concept in our last meeting. Dallas Semiconductor continues to run smoothly and
contribute significantly to our company. They contributed last quarter  percent of our sales and  percent of our profit.
Dallas Semiconductor gross margins continue to increase and in Q1, uhm, they realized a  percent gross margin and for those of you
 
that have not followed this closely, that's up from  percent gross margin just a year ago in Q1 of fiscal '02. Very impressive
improvement. During the first quarter, we shipped about  percent of the orders that we booked for turns. I mentioned that in this
comment because almost every meeting I get asked that during the discussion. We believe that Q1 and Q2 shipments are approximately
equal to the customers' consumption levels for our products during both Q4 and Q1, both Maxim and our customers continued to reduce
inventories. In Q1, you'll notice that our weighted share count decreased by  million shares.
That was due primarily to  million shares that were taken out of the count due to the treasury method calculation for option shares and
we repurchased  million shares. It appears in hindsight that our wireless customers significantly overbooked above their consumption
levels in Q4 and adjusted to consumption levels or below in Q1 bookings on Maxim. Also, during Q1, our distributors resales of our
products increased by  percent over their fourth quarter resale levels. At this point, I will stop the prepared comments and we'll open
the conference call to questions from our audience.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Well, our best shot is about as visible as -- it's probably not going to be very accurate because it's very hard to predict anything right now.
Right now, we're expecting that we'll book above last quarter's levels. We expect our revenue will be -- well, I ought to correct myself. I
misunderstood your question. Actually, you asked about bookings levels or revenue levels?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Okay. I misheard you. Our bookings are -- are not as predictable as our revenue. As I said, we expect to book above last quarter's level
but we couldn't tell you if that's going to happen at this point. As for our revenue, we also expect that our revenue will be about equal to
last quarter's revenue and we expect that our earnings will be slightly above last quarter's earnings per share.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Mostly, yes, aha.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Well, not refocusing our product direction. It's -- well, it's refocusing where we apply our applications and salespeople in the field. And
it's exactly, Michael, it's what you said. It's more a reducing the focus on the telecom and the dot-com type customers.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Well, the -- to answer the second part first, we expect Cap Ex to be below last year's Cap Ex, which is about  million. We think it will be
between  and  million this year. And, yes, you answered your own question pretty accurately. We're spending for, you know, where
we can get bargains on state-of-the-art equipment for our wafer fab we're buying and that equipment, and we're buying some test
equipment.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
No, not really. And that was the single glaring highlight or low light it was definitely noticeable.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
That's correct. Lead times are almost -- they were identical.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Well, you know, I don't think that's probably going to be, uhm, the primary -- I think we are going to get reduced below the line spending
as a percent because we are going to get sales growth. We will get spending reductions in Q2 which will come about in a number of
areas, R&D being one of the -- not one of the major ones. In fact, not at all basically. We'll be getting it primarily in other reduction areas
in the below the line category.
 
We actually intend to hire over  people in our R&D organization during the next  month. We have gotten reduction -- we have
worked very hard on spending reductions below the line and, of course, things like working plates to make masks for new products that
we have had -- we have been successful in achieving lower costs there, uhm, materially, and things like that so it's an overall expense
control thing and then we have had been able to reduce spending on people in some of the non-R&D areas.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
It has with regard to turns. I think bookings are up slightly quarter to date from last quarter. I think our turns are up about  percent
quarter to date from last quarter. So that's all I can tell you right now. That's after about four weeks.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Yeah, Torey, I do. It's about a million less than last quarter's. It's about $6.9 million.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
We can ship $500 million a quarter. -- from where we are right now.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Well, you know, it was asked to you, Alan.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Sure. Well, let's keep in mind Dallas adopted the Maxim sales force, and did away with the costly network of reps and heavy reliance on
distribution. With that said, the precision which Dallas -- new product ideas come back from the field has improved. And over the long
haul, the hit rate for the Dallas product introductions ought to be a lot better. So Torey, I couldn't say much beyond that that would give
you an insight but obviously from my comments it has been an improvement.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
You know, there was definitely an improvement in the mix that helped. And there was some cost reductions that did help in Q1, but
primarily -- I would think that it primarily -- Carl if you can help me -- I'm thinking half came from each. But I'm guessing. I know we had
a flow-through that helped.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Was it mostly? Okay. But I know that it was a mix --[INAUDIBLE].
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
That's correct.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Wireless in notebook products are lower margins than the other products and so anytime you know they -- you know, it's not a big
 
percentage change. But, I mean, they are not  percent margin products by any stretch of the imagination. But I'm just, you know,
trying to be helpful to you and tell you that, yeah, there was a little bit of a mix change away -- we probably shipped a lower percentage
of wireless products in Q1 than we did in Q4.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
But Carl --
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
As Carl said, he corrected me, that most of the change actually came from production efficiency.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
I think all of you or probably most of are you aware that the notebook market did not have a good, you know, a boom Christmas build.
And I think we saw that as well as everybody. And so I think their bookings were below what we expected in Q1.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
None of them.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
All right. No visibility. I mean, I'm not trying to be cute here. You know, it's just, uhm, there isn't visibility.
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
No. I think we're -- our belief is that our turns will go up both as a percent after revenue and percentage of bookings and as a total
absolute number. That's what we're seeing right now.
So, you know, we're -- and there's no inventory out there. So that -- those two correlate. Inventories continued to go down and turns are
up. So people are buying, you know, still -- I have no real interest in placing orders out in front of themselves, you know, a couple of
quarters ago the wireless people, you know, overbought and they readjusted that last quarter and I think we'll see bookings up this
quarter from last but we believe right now -- our people tell us that the consumption rate for our products, you know, are, you know, in
the  --  million level and that's about where we're booking right now.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
I don't know. I don't know yet.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
No. We're having -- no special plans. We're running normally.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
I do. I can almost -- I think I pretty much memorized -- roughly  or  percent in the US and  or  percent in the PAC rim. And about
 percent in Japan. And the rest of it's in Europe.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
We really don't communicate that.
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
I think I -- I -- the only thing of any relavance I commented on which was the wireless situation.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Well, none of that the -- officers took no -- had no bonus last year, and we -- none of us have will have a salary this year, so... that -- but
that hasn't impacted, you know, really any of the numbers we're talking about for Q1or Q2. You know, we have attrition which, you know,
we hired I think last year, and Carl if you have a better number, correct it, but I think we hired between  and  people last year and
our plan right now is to hire 120. So those kinds of things, uhm, you know, our bonuses, uhm, for our people will be, you know, probably
down, you know, maybe  percent from last year's level based on how, you know, those kinds of things but those are the kinds of things
we're planning.
Of course, we're looking at, you know, we're not adding overhead. Wherever we have people that are, you know, that -- where like we said
we realigned our field applications and sales organization and, you know, there were dislocations there where, you know, if people
couldn't move or transfer, you know, there were people that were resigned. But those are the kinds of things we have done and are doing.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Say that again?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
No, I didn't say that.
I'm sure I didn't say that. But that's not -- that's not correct. We need to get somewhere in the neighborhood of, uhm, I don't know, three
hundred and -- 330,  million a quarter.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
We don't walk away from anything.
 
Joseph Osha Merrill Lynch
Uhm, are you finding that not walking away involves maybe giving more on price --
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
I don't know. Our margins -- our gross margins went up.
 
Joseph Osha Merrill Lynch
Yeah, but you have been obviously you are making the organization more efficient which is great.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
I said -- well, manufacturing efficiencies, lowering costs, improving yields. That's how you become a price leader. We -- you know, people
-- we don't want people competing with us. We try to discourage them whenever we see somebody that's doing that, we are, uhm, we
don't take any prisoners on price. So... we don't start those wars. But if somebody wants to try to do that, it's -- we're not the right guys to
mess with.
 
Joseph Osha Merrill Lynch
I guess I'm just stipulating that you guys have done a good job. I'm just trying to get a sense as to how vicious that war is right now.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Not very vicious. Your margins can't go up if you have a vicious price, right? It's not an issue.
 
Joseph Osha Merrill Lynch
Okay. Thanks.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Yup.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
An officer is -- we have  or  Vice Presidents and we have a CEO.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
And last year, none of us got -- none of us got a bonus.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Zero. And this year, we've all -- I -- well, let's see. We have air, uhm,... I think the -- -- I took -- I'm getting no salary this year starting in
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
We've also, uhm, just -- we might as well add to this, uhm, a group of us have also put back or cancelled about a million and a half
shares of options which we put back into the pool so that we could -- so other employees who could get those options so -- that were
reissued to other employees.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Well, you know, we don't like to disappoint people. And we like to be able to operate without -- and you know, on a daily basis and be
able to sleep at night. I don't think the company -- that's the way the company was always run. We want to make sure that we are not
struggling to make our numbers.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
We're ahead of our plan.
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Well, no. At  million a quarter, we would be running at about  or  percent of capacity.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
That's correct.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
We are about  percent utilization at the current levels.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Let me -- I think I understand you. You never want to run at  percent capacity. Okay? So --
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
You know, you approach  percent. At that point you really don't have  percent capacity to use. You understand that?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Okay.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
A lot more excess capacity than I would like to have and if we can get up to  or  percent we'll have a material improvement in gross
margins.
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
I think it's too long of an answer to be -- to give justice to the question to do on this conference call.
I've talked to you about it if you would like to call in afterwards but we're quite pleased and as now excited about that opportunity and we
have done well. I mean, we've booked a couple of -- we've booked not a couple. We've booked a $700 million order, which -- I'm sorry.
$700,000 order. [ Laughter ] Which is indicative of the fact that we do have something to contribute in that area. So... I -- I think -- we'll
talk about it later if you would like.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
I'm ignorant of that -- of the Lexmark/Dell relationship but the answer, you are correct we do have a good relationship with Lexmark and
I would imagine that if it causes Lexmark to sell more it would help us.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
I hope not. You know,  million of that came from the stock price going down. You know, I don't know how familiar you are with the way
the Treasury method of counting shares is, but you don't count a share if it's below water. And an option share. So, uhm, you know, it
would -- they would go down -- it wouldn't go down materially unless -- the stock price continued to go down.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Well, I think most of what was going to go on for the holiday season happened mostly last quarter. So I think you could -- you obviously
have other people you can ask that same question too. But it's my -- and I don't pay a lot of attention to studying the consumer market.
 
But I don't think that the notebook sales are going to be -- you know, what, you know, if -- booming for the -- for the holiday season.
Other than that we're not really having -- we don't have any visibility for the consumer market per se. We could look at the notebook as
being a consumer market to a large extent. To some extent. Handsets, phones, I mean, those are not -- those are consumer product but
they're not holiday-oriented. So -- but I would -- I mean, I'm anxious as you are to see how retail sales go during the holidays. I just don't
have much visibility right now.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Yeah, you know, I really don't comment on those things. I do know, of course, but I'd rather not comment.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Well, yeah. Q4 was -- let me put it -- let me see if I can give you this in context. Q4 was above Q3 by about  percent. Yeah. Q4 was
about  percent up. From Q3. And then Q4 was down about  percent -- Q1 was down about  percent from Q1.
So if you drew a line through the booking trends over some number of quarters you'll see that the wireless was growing but they just --
they went out and bought a place out of panic probably. I mean, but probably a poor choice of words but their anticipation of growth and
demand for their product several wireless companies you know, placed orders and, you know, in Q3 that they're burning off inventory in
Q4. And Q1 and Q4. So it wasn't like that market was down. It was -- they just really overbooked in Q4. So the trend line -- if you drew -- if
you ignored Q4, the trend line between Q3 and Q1 would be up.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Mm-hm.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
You know, those are, first of all, the answer is no, I really can't talk about the first question. It's -- that's obviously proprietary. That's
 
where we're focusing and what people we are looking for. And I just don't want to talk about that. And the other question, I -- I -- hate to
be not helpful here but the other question is just, uhm, you know, too complicated to get into any meaningful discussion on, on this call
so I would talk to you about the second question if you want to call back in.
 
Steven Rossin Lynn Capital Management
Okay. I'll follow up on that later. Thank you.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
I think you are coming over to see us anyway, aren't you?
 
Steven Rossin Lynn Capital Management
We hope so. We don't have a date yet.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Okay.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
What was that Peter? Nothing surprises you.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Oh. Okay.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
How many shares?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
I always listen, you know, and, you know, I don't always -- and I listen to that gentleman and I thought about it some more and, uhm, I
thought about, you know, well, what's wrong with a dividend?
And what's right with a dividend? And we came to the conclusion that we're a very stable company. Our earnings are very predictable.
 
We have certainly the wherewithal to pay dividends. And I think a dividend reflects largely that a company is stable and has predictable
growth and so in that light, we decided that it would -- our shareholders should receive some small dividend. And we think it's overall
positive. There are also some investors who can't invest in a stock if the stock --
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
-- doesn't pay a dividend. So in taking it you know, everything under consideration, it seemed like that gentleman's idea was not as off
the wall as I may have made it sound in that call. And we -- and it cause immediate to think about it.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
I can't clear thank you.
It's your observation. It's not mine. I can't clear it up. It didn't occur to me that it had anything to do with growth. If you don't grow and
don't have a good future, I don't think you should be looking at paying a dividend. But I would look -- I look at it just the opposite.
To me, if you have, you know, if you are not going to need all of your money and certainly our dividend is in no way a large -- we earned --
I mean, our dividend, I think, is worth about $30 million a quarter. I mean, we earned $130 million in cash this quarter. I mean, it's a small
number. You know, I think our dividend -- I intended our dividend to reflect just how much money in cash we do generate.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
 million a year I guess is not --
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
 million a year, right? What did I say, 30?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
I meant a year. No wonder. I meant a year. We'll make, you know, we'll a make $400 million in cash and earnings and  million of that is
10% of that.
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Well, most people are more -- I mean, most people are more -- I hope and I believe that people really think a lot more than that. I mean, I
certainly didn't even occur to me that a dividend would be a negative thing.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
My only concern at paying a dividend is do we need, you know, can we use that cash to either buy back more stock or to buy equipment or
for an acquisition. And if I felt that that lack of -- that that cash would detract from opportunities in any of those areas, then I would
probably wouldn't do it but, you know, we've scaled it to where it's a non-issue, right?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Mm-hm.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
You know, that is the right number. And I can't give you any more information on it than that I just don't have any more insight. You mean
I'm assuming you -- you are asking, you know, is it in one sector, one equipment area, or something like that? I just don't know. It's across
the board, I would imagine.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
I looked at it as a positive sign, but, of course, we're all looking for positive signs. I mean, I was -- I was comforted by the fact that the
resales were up and they weren't down which means that there's not a negative trend going on there for our product lines. That's all I can
tell you I just draw the same conclusions that you might or anybody else might. I just don't know a lot more. If the distributor resales are
up  percent, not too much bad is probably going on.
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
It would be a  percent guess. We'll both guess and bet a dollar on it.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
I just don't know.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Could you speak up a little bit, please?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Uhm, you mean after four weeks? Is that what you're talking about?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Well, I tell you, these four weeks are a little better -- marginally better, you know, than they were the first four weeks of last quarter, but,
you know, we were looking into the holidays and a thought we were looking in a growth second two months of last quarter and that really
didn't happen. They didn't -- they didn't pick up as I thought they might. Will they this quarter?
I don't know. I mean, I hope they do. I think they will. I mean, it's our feeling that we're going to book more this quarter than last quarter.
But... we don't have any basis for it other than that we think last quarter was depressed by overbooking in Q3 and we do think there is a
growth trend. Going on here. We don't think it's -- we think it's not a -- a -- a -- an aggressive growth trend per quarter but we do believe
that there is growth. I mean, if he would can get these cycles or these per it your [INAUDIBLE] out of the way, we think there's growth. I
 
don't think we're looking right now, we don't believe we're in a  percent per year growth situation. But I think we'll see bookings up
slightly maybe up, I just don't know, maybe up  million? Our business units think we're going to book the demand is about  million.
In this quarter. That's what they think [INAUDIBLE] is. But so we'll have to wait and see.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Oh, okay.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
I wasn't being responsive. We just listened. We could have just just as easily listened and thought about it and we don't really agree with
you.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Well, you not you're counting a hell of a lot on hindsight, okay? I mean, anybody can just like you know guess building Dusty Baker and
the Giants but that's great on Monday but you know, you don't know -- what you have to do is you have to look at, you know, how much
do you believe in your company and where is it going to get to? And if you believe you are going to do $2 billion and make $2 a share or
$2.50 a share and you believe in truly there will be a set of companies that are valued at 30-1, PE, 40-1 or whatever, and if you are -- and
if you do have stock option program where there is, you know, there is dilution, as a result of it, there is a clear strategy and a logic that
 
leads you to buy shares back every quarter. -- because you feel it -- you know, I feel that it is in our shareholders' best interests to do that
and that's the way we think about it. Sometime most -- and I think store cloudy we have been absolutely correct in doing that. And I think
going forward we are going to be correct in that, too [ historically ]
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
It's going -- it's the same as what it is except it's going to go up by whatever  or  million is divided by did  years. You know?  or 
years. So it will probably go up about, you know,  million over what it was the rate it was last year.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Yeah.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
You really want an exact number, call Carl Jasper and he will give the number. We know exactly what it is. There is not going to be any
dramatic increases.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Mm-hm.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Hi.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
I think that, uhm -- it's going to happen when it -- oh, it's going to happen. When it happens I'm not sure. But it happens -- has to happen
because inventory levels are too low and any source of growth in demand will accelerate and [INAUDIBLE] that event. I think that what is
probably going to, you know, we are going to have to wait until fundamentally the economy has digested the unemployment that's
occurred and, uhm, and maybe is not completely over yet. And some of the spending that was going on by these companies that now
aren't spending or don't exist anymore.
And I think everybody is kind of guarded to see what the -- what grassroots base level we're a and we don't still know that yet. And so,
you know, we're probably, you know, 4,  months away from getting to a baseline. And I don't think you are going to see any --ny, uhm,
any renewed enthusiasm until that happens. I think as far as economic growth, as far as stock price growth I think that's almost
disconnected to business. I think we need, you know, I happen to believe that this housecleaning has to occur and it's good that we need
these regulations and we need the scrutiny of these CEOs and these companies. And I think the accountant have been overblamed for
the problems that are really the result of investment banking and the analyst system and the company managements. And I think I think
they are doing the correct job in -- in cleaning that up. And I think once that cleans up, we are going to, uhm, people, investors will be
able to take a deep breath and say I can trust this situation now. And, you know, I think that's an important event to occur or to get
beyond us.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
We have not changed anything. So I'm not sure what you're talking about. We have not done anything different. Maybe you can tell me
what you're referring to because we don't know what it is.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Oh, product announcements. Oh, I think -- yeah, we are. We did actually do that. [ Laughter ] Uhm, if you want to call me back in, I'll tell
you why we're doing that but that's -- nothing -- yeah. We did do that. We announced some product over press releases over the wire. We
had a -- we have a tricky reason for doing that. Not very -- not very strategic.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
No, it's just the RF stuff.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Our wireless business unit includes cell phones, space station, all the radios, nothing to do with battery management or any sort of
processing. But it's the radios, the cell phones, the wireless LANs, satellite, and space stations and consumer RF.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Uhm, out of that business unit, we ship just what I told you. The one that I said had that dramatic --
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Okay.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Uhm... yeah. I think that most -- we are going to realize some productivity improvements in the coming  months in our engineering
efforts but I think most of that was due to body -- just an added labor. Added engineering.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Yeah. I think coming forward -- going forward, we will get productivity improvements which we have done because we have done an
 
enormous amount of work and installed the systems that are going to we think result in some significant improvements in productivity.
But -- in engineering, our product development area. But we have not realized those yet. They have not kicked in. So what we reported
there I reported there was really a more a result of the added engineering that we've added over the last  months.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
So, I don't want to give any more color on it. I think you can figure it out. We are not trying to be tricky. We have had a linement of
customers. You can all figure out what, you what's hot and what's not. What's changes and what doesn't exist any more. What does.
And even geographically, so, you know, it was -- it's needed, you know, you don't sit there with that same key customer list and operate
on that when they aren't the same people anymore. Some of them aren't there anymore.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Aha.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Oh, gosh. Wow, this is not going to help you much. But, you know, we have  product lines --  product lines and they -- they're all
developing new products. There's not any dramatic emphasis where we're emphasizing and one is dominating it. I would say it's across
the board really.
 
Robert Burleson Investec
Okay. That's fair. My other question is on the interest income line, are you guys seeing further maybe decrease to that interest income
from lower interest rates like other guys out there are seeing?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Well, we're pretty flat now. But we -- you know, we had -- my approach to managing our money is that it's not our money it's our
shareholders' money and we are not in the business of trying to make money on money and the worst thing you can do as a CEO is lose
you know, lose money fooling around financially with it. So we've always had the philosophy of investing in 90-day -- we have gone out
maybe to a year, you know, treasury. So we hit -- you know, we went down from whatever,  percent down to 1.5 percent interest rates.
But we have been down there, you know, already. So there was no real change this quarter over last. Okay, great. Thanks a lot.
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Hey, yeah capital.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
You are going to have to speak more clearly. We can't understand you.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Well, my thoughts on that -- the law allows you to treat -- from a tax point of view, tax law lets you take that as a deduction. And we do
that. And it's a significant -- it helps our shareholders tremendously in terms of creating cash for us. So it's a positive thing for
companies, for corporations and shareholders, that the tax law let's do you that.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Well, it depends on how you think about it. If Maxim, 96,  percent of our employees have stock options. And they probably couldn't
have those stock options if we didn't have some way that allowed them not to be, you know, to get -- we get some benefit from the gain
they get in the options. I mean, I don't know that -- if you want to be altruistic about it, the government is giving back to 7,000 employees
a tax cut. Effectively.
I mean, they are getting a stock option as a result of this -- they are giving a tax break because to us to our shareholders because we give
a stock option to one -- to 7,000 employees. We can come up with all sort -- I know that's a legitimate way to think about that there's
other benefits like, you know, that are given by the government, tax breaks, when do you things for people. And this is our shares are
going to our employees.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
I'm sorry. Speak more slowly.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
Right.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
All right. Thanks.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - President, Chairman, CEO
We really don't have any closing remarks.
If there's anything that's not clear relative to what I said or further amplification on it, we'll be happy to take calls and clarify those things.
And both Carl Jasper and myself are available to do that. Thank you.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
CONFERENCE CALL PARTICIPANTS
 
Integrated Products. On the call today from the company are Jack F. Gifford chairman, president, and CEO. Amanda Lazar, managing
director of corporate policy and communications, Alan Hail, vice president, chief financial officer of Dallas semiconductor, and, myself,
Carl Jasper, vice president of finance and chief financial officer. Before we get started, i'd like to take care of a couple of administrative
items. First of all, we will be making forward looking statements on this call. In light of the private securities litigation reform act, I would
like to remind you, statements we make about the future including our intentions or expectations, or predictions of the future, including
but not limited to, possible statements regarding bookings and terms orders, revenues and earnings, inventory and spending levels,
manufacturing efficiency or capacity, projected inmarket consumption of our product, and any other future financial results are forward
looking statements. If we use words like anticipate, believe, project, forecast, estimate or variations of these words, and similar
interpretations relating to the future, they are intended to be forward looking statements. It is important to note the company's actual
results could differ materially from these projected forward looking statements.
Additional information about risk and uncertainties associated with the companies business are contained in the company's SEC filings
on form 10-k for the year ended June 29th, 2002. Copies can be obtained from the company or the SEC. Secondly, in keeping with the
SEC's fair disclosure requirements, we have made time available for question and answer period. This is your opportunity to ask
questions of management concerning the quarterly results and expectations for next quarter. An operator will provide instructions at
that time. Hopefully you have all had a chance to read the press release covering our Q2 results. For those of you who have not seen it, I
will now cover the financial contents of the release.
Net revenue for the fiscal second quarter ending December 28th,  were 286.1 million dollars. An increase over the 247.1 million
reported for the second quarter of fiscal 2002, unchanged from reported revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Net income for the
quarter was 77.1 million dollars. And increase over the 62.6 million reported last year and an increase over the 73.2 million reported for
the previous quarter. Diluted earnings per share were  cents for the second quarter. An increase over the  cents reported for the
same period a year ago and up from the  cents reported for the first quarter of fiscal 2003. During the quarter, cash and short-term
investments increased $158 million to $945.7 million. After the company repurchased 500,000 shares of its common stock for $18.3
 
million, paid dividends of 6.4 million and acquired a total of 8.4 million of capital equipment. Accounts receivable decreased by 12.9
million dollars in the second quarter to 122.6 million. And inventory decreased 8.4 million dollars to 127.9 million. Inventories have
decreased $19.8 million from the third quarter fiscal  levels and no inventory growth is anticipated for the third quarter of fiscal
2003.
Gross margin for the second quarter increased slightly to 69.7% after increasing inventory reserves $3 million, compared to 69.5%
reported for the first quarter. Second quarter bookings were approximately  million dollars, up slightly from the first quarter level.
Returns orders received during the quarter $139 million, an 8% increase over the  million received in the prior quarter. Returns orders
are customer orders that are for delivery within the same quarter and may result in revenue within the same quarter if the company has
available inventory that matches those orders. Order cancellations continue to be below historical levels. Bookings increased in the
Pacific Rim in Europe, but decreased in the U.S. and japan. Second quarter ending backlogs shippable within the next  months was
approximately $201 million including  million requested for shipment in the third quarter fiscal 2003. I will now turn the call over to
Jack Gifford who will provide a commentary on the quarter.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Thank you, Carl. During Q2, corporate bookings were up slightly. Maxim's bookings were up 4%. The following was with Dallas bookings
which were down 20% over the last two quarters,  percent in the last quarter. We have identified the cause of the Dallas decline as
primarily lost business through our U.S. Pac Rim and China distributors. We've taken corrective action and we expect significant growth
in Dallas distribution bookings in Q3. Corporate turns that were up 8% quarter over quarter and again Maxim's were up 63% of bookings.
The Dallas turns were down 16%. We also expect Dallas third quarter turns to grow significantly from the Q2 level. Overall bookings for
the corporation were up slightly, I'll go through a little bit of color here on the various geographic markets. Q2 bookings in the U.S. were
down primarily as a result of the end of the purchasing period for christmas manufacturing, which occurred in mostly in the quarter
before that. Our Industrial networking product line, however, did see growth in the U.S.
The Pac Rim bookings were up due to no booking computer rated product. Europe the bookings were up due to industrial, major orders
from major industrial companies in Europe. The Telecom and the base station markets did not recover, however. Japan was slightly down
from the Q1 levels. Our distribution business in the U.S. as far as their in market bookings was actually up, although the Dallas portion
was down. We were up $55 million compared to  for Q1. And our distributors shipped  million dollars. So, they had a positive book to
build. Q2 beginning backlog was down 8% for the corporation overall from the beginning Q1 backlog. Bookings in turns, however, for Q3
to date are ahead of Q2. If we discounted the first week of the quarter, new year's week, the last three weeks we're averaging at a rate --
averaging such that the quarterly rate for bookings would be over  million dollars for the quarter. We have to wait and see, but this
could be good news. We do expect to book over  million.
Below line spending was lower in Q2 primarily due to lower prices that we were able to obtain for engineering services, such as, working
plates and other things, controlled discretionary spending such as travel and entertainment. We also had salary freeze and we reduced
bonuses for below line personnel. These -- the freezes and the bonus reductions will be reinstated as soon as revenue growth improves to
levels that are acceptable to us. As a result of the improved below line spending, we've gone from the beginning -- in the last  months
from Q1 of '03 -- I'm sorry from Q1 of '03, we've gone from 32.7% below line spending to just under 31% in Q2 just ending. And this was
done without -- while we increased our circuit design head counts. Of below the line during Q2, below the line head count dropped 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Thank you.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
We think that our revenue, Mike, will be no worse than what we did last quarter. As you can tell from the numbers that I gave you, we do
need to grow bookings which we think will happen. Depending on what our bookings end up and the turns, it will determine the revenue.
Our plan is to fundamentally have the same revenue that we had this quarter. Great. Gross margin you talked about some cost savings
from the Dallas side. What would gross margins have looked like without that. Was it a material impact and is it stable going forward. It
is stable going forward, part of our grand plan to get Dallas's gross margins to the maximum levels. They are running at about 63%. And,
you know, therefore, if our blended is somewhere in the 70% area, Maxim is running higher than that. So, we think that slowly they will
improve to those levels. There is some inherent low margin products. Some of those products will not be able to achieve that level. The
new products they are introducing, they have been quite prolific in launching and introducing products, we are quite optimistic we can
achieve this goal. I would say that we are not in the short term meaning in the next year going to really see any gross margin fall off in
Maxim corporate.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
There is always competition, but we are in  product lines. So, you know, some of them more competitive and price competitive than
others. For the most part there isn't. And we pride ourselves on being, you know, the lead low cost producer where we have products in
our markets. We have room. We don't, as I said before, we really don't consider price attrition a material issue.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
They were basically two product lines that were not managed as well as they should have been. If you don't tend the store, you can lose
business. And, you know, I could blame the distributors but, frankly that's not their problem. We're supposed to be paying attention to
our business. So, we've corrected that and we consider it to be an aberration. Unfortunately, we didn't detect or really recognize the
issues. We could have recognized that earlier but we spent -- we now have and have done the things we need to do.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Yeah, I really -- it would be difficult to comment because it's customer by customer. And we're not in the hand set business in the general
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
We are very concerned that it's completely frivolous. We have examined all the patents. They by the way have never served us which is
unbelievable. But we believe they have -- it's filed as a marketing ploy. If so, we will go to whatever extent it takes to prosecute on that
basis. We believe it was filed to intimidate customers who are completely licensed by Qualcomm. So, we think it's a marketing ploy. They
still have not talked to us, yet we have now talked to -- made calls saying if we don't hear from them soon, we will file a complaint. And
we've examined the patents extensively, our patents, we checked with our customers about their licenses. They say there is absolutely --
they have no problem buying from somebody other than Qualcomm, so we're very upset by this. It hasn't hurt us but it was intended to.
 
Christopher Caso SoundView Technology Group
Right. Okay. Just one final question regarding your comments on, you know, not continuing to decrease your inventory going forward.
Does that -- I guess does that suggest an increase in production at the fabs, will you be running the fabs at the same levels over the next
couple of quarters.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
It will be an increase in production. We will increase probably 10% in the fabs.
 
Christopher Caso SoundView Technology Group
About 10%?
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Maybe more like 8% but in that ballpark.
 
 
Christopher Caso SoundView Technology Group
Okay. All right. Thank you.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
I do. Carl will have to look it up. It was quite low. We did one thing that made it a little higher. We have a policy that since our products
are highly proprietary. We have to be careful about what our distributors buy. Often times they will buy for inventory, and we will make
the product, and they will return it. We have nonreturn policy on several products. That encourages are distributors to buy only what they
can resell. So having said that, I think it was  million. What was it last quarter.  million last quarter.  million this quarter.
 
Daniel Gelbeck CIBC World Markets
With regard to product mix, do you offer a breakout of that?
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Of what.
 
Daniel Gelbeck CIBC World Markets
Your product mix. Power management, process control, mixed signal.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Revenue.
 
Daniel Gelbeck CIBC World Markets
Revenue points of view.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
No, we don't.
 
Daniel Gelbeck CIBC World Markets
All right. Thank you very much, then.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Sure.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Yeah. I think there is going to be -- it's hard for me to be exact. That's our plan. It could be down slightly because some of the stuff we are
doing is ongoing. There is room, particularly Dallas to improve. But generally, yeah, the -- most of it has been affected but it will be
slightly -- moved slightly down. Margins will continue to improve slightly.
 
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Now?
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
I would be guessing right now. It's not as big as it's going to be in the next  months. Let's see. What is -- Carl, what is wireless's
revenue?
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
I think the wireless business unit will grow, one of the faster growing business units. We're a leader in the wireless lan area, satellite area,
you know, even the  megahertz low frequency RF area, were in that area. We are in power amplifiers. We got a lot of vehicles, base
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
I think -- that's a good question. A thoughtful question. We are clearly going to, you know, watch where we know that we have volatile
products, turn at the last moment or tend to, we will put more inventory in on those products.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Stop reducing the inventories. That has the same effect.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Yeah, I do.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Okay. The -- inmarket bookings, let me deal with inmarket bookings. This is a pie chart. This will be just as well. The U.S. Is 32%. Europe
-- that's down from  last -- I'm sorry. Down from -- hang on one second. Yeah. That's down from 35% last quarter. The Europe was
20%. That's up by one -- up from  last quarter. Pac Rim is 11%, which is -- no, I'm sorry. These lines are -- Japan is 11%. Down from 12%.
And the Pac Rim is 36% up from 34%.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
That is inmarket bookings. Those are orders from a real customer. As opposed to a distributor. I'm sure you are aware a lot of Pac Rim
stuff is U.S. Designed material that they buy and build in the Pac Rim.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Yeah, I can. We have to look at it here. I'm just going to tell you in terms of up or down, okay? The portable equipment business was down
slightly. Communications market was over all down slightly. That has telecom in it that drug it -- drag it down. Telecom was down again
from -- it continues to go down. Our data converter business was up materially. Our standard products business, which is the most broad
of all of our business units, it covers everything, it was up slightly -- up measurably. And, you know, that pretty much in broad categories
covers everything.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Well, yeah, I think the Fall business will be up. The notebook business will be up. And the Industrial sectors, they were up last quarter. I
think they will be up this quarter. We've seen three good weeks in a row. That's at high levels. That tells me -- I really believe that we will
see a significantly better quarter.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
It's a completely a function of where the bookings end up and how much of it are turnable and whether we can turn them.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Sure can.
 
Joseph Osha Merrill Lynch Global Securities
Wonder if you could comment a little bit specifically on the notebook and market. There seems to be a lot of design activity being driven
by the introduction of Banias. Is that something that could move this slice of your business up materially and I have a follow-up?
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
I don't believe so. It's already -- we are established in the sectors we are in, and I think we will make progress in the display area, but
there is also competition in some of the other areas. I expect it won't change a percentage of our business.
 
Joseph Osha Merrill Lynch Global Securities
Okay. The second question, it seemed based on the calls I was making that there was a rather hard draw down of inventories held by
distributors, especially in the latter part of the December quarter, and now perhaps that that might be reversing. I was wondering if you
could comment, particularly in light of the effect that we will enter a little bit of a dead period here because of the lunar, new year, then
pick back up. I'm wondering what the tone of what you are getting from your distributors is relative to the end of last quarter.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Well, actually, the distributor inventories did go down. But, frankly, we had an aberration that I alluded to in terms of the Dallas booking,
and had the Dallas results been as expected, we would have actually had significant increase in bookings and felt it more so than I
reported. So, I would say that the distributors are actually seeing a better business environment right now.
 
Joseph Osha Merrill Lynch Global Securities
Do you think you might be getting loaded up here a little bit in front of a quiet period, first part of February because of lunar new year.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
You mean the lunar new year.
 
Joseph Osha Merrill Lynch Global Securities
Chinese new year.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
No, no, I think our distributors are inventory conscious. They really don't start to do that until they are feeling shortages. So -- because
they compete with one another. In our case that doesn't happen that often. We have two distributors in the U.S. and they have the same
part. I don't expect any bizarre behavior or ordering patterns to occur.
 
Joseph Osha Merrill Lynch Global Securities
Just to confirm, other than Arrow, your other large distributor is who?
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Abnet.
 
Joseph Osha Merrill Lynch Global Securities
Okay. Thank you.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Well, you always ask a number of questions. I have trouble remembering. The first one, I would like to see if I can go back and answer the
first one -- the first question first. Dallas's revenues are approximately 25% of our business. And their profits are also, you know, rather
less than that because of the margins, but not much less. So, they have that kind of an effect on us. And the problems that they had were
very tactical and not strategic. I mean, they -- they just were very -- I mean, in their defense, I mean their business management people,
guys that run the business, are focused on new product development, new product definition and they take for granted a little more than
they should, they did. What is happening on a daily business relative to the orders, winning, losing and pricing and that sort of thing. And
the people that -- in the trenches doing that were not really the -- as experienced and as good as doing that as they should have been.
General manager wasn't paying as much attention as they should have been. Errors were made that shouldn't have been made. But very
correctable and have been corrected. And that's the answer to your first question. Is that right?
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Second question, I believe, is having to do with what should you read into the fact that we're going to slightly increase our wafer move.
We certainly -- well, we have -- we have a fixed expense pretty much to make -- run our fabs. And the fabs without spending any more
money could produce easily 10% more wafers, you know, other than a small amount of money for starting materials or whatever. And
we've chosen -- up until now, we chose to actually not do that. We would just run with less efficiency. So -- we still wouldn't increase the
output if we didn't anticipate that we could benefit from the output in some market or business way. So we are going to increase the
output of wafers which would create an inventory profit, a small amount. It would go from -- probably have flat inventory growth this
quarter rather than down. But that helps the productivity of there fab. That's not why we are doing it. We are doing it because, I believe, I
can't remember Joe or somebody asked earlier, what will are you doing to help yourself with turns. If you want to turn more business.
One of the things, having more material on products that you guess are going to be the ones that turn will help that. We also, because,
mostly, some of the markets we are in are very -- the customers are hand to mouth and we just hate to get into these expedite modes
where they miss forecast and they have growth and then, you know, we have the same problem, they need product, we have to scramble
around which is very disruptive. We are trying to minimize the effect of that in the next cycle. We will try to guess where to build some of
that stuff.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
For which quarter.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
For Q3? I think our inmarket number is very close to 290. I'm trying to -- I saw the number. I don't know where to look to find it right,
again. I think that is our shift demand number what we call it. Yeah, basically 290.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Between  and 292.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
The consumption is predicted to go up at a higher rate it's been going up. That's what we are told.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Well, first of all, the reason we go to the man month is almost impossible to do -- to get -- to equate it to products. We have products
that are only like, basically, three man months to develop and we have others more than a few that are in excess of  man months, as
high as  man months of product. So, it just gets to be, you know, so it becomes confusing -- we are really confusing you and I don't
want to say misleading, but the fact is you really don't have much of an idea at all, as to the productivity, if I talk to you products. I need
to talk to you about man month's introduced. That's meaningful. Having said that, our man months introduced this quarter were less
than the man months introduced last quarter. But that happens. I mean, it's not a linear thing because if you can imagine, the number of
products we have in development and some of them have three man month maturities or design times and others have 40. You got
peaks and bubbles. We expect clearly for the year that our man months introduced will be up from last quarter, last year's man months
introduced. There is irregularity quarter to quarter. Remember a couple of quarters ago there was a big blip, positive blip. I think we
introduced 46% more man months in one quarter over another, if I recall. And, you know, that's not normal either, right.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
We -- no, obviously, we've done some things that we want to -- you know, we didn't feel across the board in the entire company we didn't
feel it was appropriate to pay bonuses out as if we were blowing the balls off things and so everybody in a cooperative way have had their
bonuses reduced in some cases -- my case 100%. On average, the cash reduction of bonuses has probably been 50%, maybe lower.
Maybe 40. But it's in that ballpark. We want to restore it which we think that we are delivering results that people are going to -- our
share holders will be happy with. Same goes for, you know, we have a salary freeze for everybody which, you know, has -- which started a
couple of -- started in Q1 I guess but that's -- that has -- if you take average increase of 3, 4, or 5%, we aren't doing that, so we won't
reinstitute that until -- our thought was it would be four quarters from Q1, because we wouldn't be fair to the ones getting reviewed in the
fourth quarter to not have a freeze and the other ones to have it. Our objective is to restore that as soon as possible. The other thing,
though, that we are planning on doing, going forward here, our first priority is to meet our head count requirements in the product
development area and we feel that, as I told you in previous meetings, with the acquisition of Dallas, fortunately we have abundance of
engineering might be too dramatic a statement, but our head count already puts us in good status to meet our new development plan
 
without adding anybody this year. We are, though, going to hire, continue to hire critical engineers as they become available to us. That
can make contributions.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
There is no doubt that the Dallas people are making a significant contribution in engineering productivity. We are very happy with the
products that are launching, the minute we reduced the iteration rate, the definition quality is improved and ability to improve
tremendously. They are well along, they are ahead of the plan we had for them as to where they would reach this level of maturity and
professionalism. I'm quite happy with them. They are right now as good as anybody else has got or probably better. We are getting that
pickup. There is no doubt about that.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
53% last -- wait a minute. Am I right on that, Carl? I'm not right.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Turns shipped, as Carl hands me this,  -- I'm sorry. You better just -- Q2 actuals Maxim and Dallas. What am I looking at? This is the
wrong column. Q1 turn ship was 61%. The Q2 turn ship were 75%.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Shipped  -- we shipped  million out of  turned and quarter before we shipped  million out of  million.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
No. No.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Yes. That's right.
 
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
First question absolutely identified it. We're counting on turns. That's shakey. You got to be able to ship the turns, too. We don't want to
get something, you know, better could happen but we can't predict -- we have to execute on that.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
I don't have it. I should have it, but I don't. I'll find it out if someone wants to call. I can give you that advice
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
I just don't know what it is right now. It's up enough that I should know it.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
We will take that to death. We are going to take that to commodity stage. We will be the leader in 802.11 chipsets. We have good
partners. We are doing everything anybody would want. Our technology is -- we get better performance and high levels of performance.
We're doing the B, the A, the A+G, all of them.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
We already are. Absolutely. We are definitely -- I think you could confirm with our customers that we're more than a threat to them. I
think you got it backwards.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
I'm trying to see. Why would it come back.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
No. No. We didn't write off anything that didn't have some -- we're not doing that. We don't do that. The inventory we write off has some
basis for being written off.
 
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Yeah. That's right. You said it.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
We want to be -- with revenue growth, we would like to be back where our total below the line is in the  to 27% area.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
That's just due to them reducing inventories. You know, improving their book to bill or whatever you want to call it, and we're part of that
problem, if -- it's not a problem, but we are careful about not shipping into inventory for them. We don't want them to have inventory,
particularly because in some cases they can return it, you know, and at Maxim it's difficult we don't have policies that allow it. It's just as
much our inventory management of their inventory than anything else.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Okay. You're welcome.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
I wish that some of the business managers had heard that comment. I'm laughing because obviously they took some prisoners. But there
is no -- there is no basic pricing problems out there. But we don't want to lose business on price. We don't want to be -- we don't want to
be destroying markets either, but if we got -- most of our business comes from products we designed in. In the Dallas cases, they lost
orders on businesses they had invented, which they won't do any more because they didn't choose to be competitive, either consciously or
unconsciously. We got the cost structures to not lose orders. So, we won't lose them. But I don't -- nothing has happened since the last
conference call that changed that environment.
 
 
Ross Seymore Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. A bit more of an industry level for quite some time we have been hearing that turns orders historic highs as a percentage of total
revenues and visibility was at historic lows and people keep saying that that can't last but it seams to be more persistent than anyone
imagined. In your experience, what will turn that around other than the obvious answer just simply being demand?
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
You know, the visibility, the customers are just -- are not prepared. They want flexibility. They are realizing their markets are fickle.
Today's world is -- quick is good and slow is dead. They got to anticipate what people are going to buy, and have it. So their interest in
inventories is more than an economic one. They just oftentimes don't -- have a lot of notice as to where they will get to and go to and
which products are going to sell and which are not. We don't like to -- I can remember years ago that it was sort of a statement to say,
"I'm in the consumer business." But frankly, a lot of what has sold in micro electronics today is a consumer product. If it's -- an
automobile is. Computer as consumer product. Like it or not, we and our customers are in the consumer business. We are not, you know
-- our industrial market segment is material, but it's not a majority of it. So, any time you are selling product that depends on the
consumer's desires, it ripples back to us, too. They want flexibility, our customers do, and I think this idea of long -- of no long-term
planning is really actually is planning. They really want to be able to react quickly to change. Now, where that blows up on them is where
they are so hand to mouth, and so ready to move in one direction or another, which something does take off or we have a turn, we have
growth which we will have, they get in situations where their suppliers can't react. That's what you will have happen.
 
Ross Seymore Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thank you.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
That's not correct, by the way. That's not a correct statement. Our major competitive is not Linear.
 
Alex Burmann NG Edwards
I guess [INAUDIBLE] would be similar company.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
That's not even correct.
 
Alex Burmann NG Edwards
Okay.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
ADI are more similar than it is to us.
 
Alex Burmann NG Edwards
Okay. Got it. Fair enough. They talked about some issues with ASP's, not a problem but due to package sizes and mixed shipping to the
consumers, they talk about a pricing sort of coming down to them in the last quarter. Is that a trend that you have seen at all, or do you
think it's an industry trend. I want to get your take on that?
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Not to delve in ltc's business, I don't know it very well, our ASP's frankly -- our products are being more integrated, a higher level of
integration, which doesn't say they are any more profitable but that means ASP's will not go down, they will probably go up. In other
 
words, if you go from building chips of one size to chips that are now 50% bigger, you must be selling more content, so you get a higher
ASP. It doesn't say anything about your gross margins. So, I don't think ltc -- I know, they don't sell the level of integration that we do. For
instance, they don't build any of the wireless lan stuff. They don't build the phone stuff, the complicated data converters that are big. So
-- and expensive. So, it's not surprising that there ASP's might go down. It doesn't mean the margins will go down, and consequently
because it doesn't go down or up doesn't mean the margins will go down or up either.
 
Alex Burmann NG Edwards
Also, do you -- just looking through the 30,000 [INAUDIBLE] you are thinking of yourself as a 30% growth company. I guess you are
looking at the end markets, if I look at a lot of them, they appear like they have slowed not so much for GDP reasons, some they slowed
like wireless, pc, they don't grow as fast in the future as they did in the past.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
You got a lot of insight that I don't have have. I just see the wireless business exploding. I can't imagine anything being built in the future
that doesn't have a wireless connection. We disagree.
 
Alex Burmann NG Edwards
I'm pointing, specifically to the wireless hand set.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
I guarantee you that analog phone sets won't grow and GSM won't grow. That's small, nobody expects them to be growth areas. What
you are implying is that low cost data, voice and data is not going to be desired more in the future than in the past. I just don't agree with
you.
 
Alex Burmann NG Edwards
No, I agree with you that demand will grow, I'm saying if you look at each of the end markets, it seems that the growth rates have slowed.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
I really can't comment on that. You are much closer than I.
 
Alex Burmann NG Edwards
Fair enough. One final question. Just, I mean, it seems like most of the other companies in semi's that I follow break down revenues in
application and it's helpful to investors. I know you haven't done it in the past. I'm not suffer if it's something that you -- a lot of people
ask. Every conference call people ask what is the revenue per application. You say you don't want to say.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
It's Proprietary. Where our product planning and direction goes is, you know, that's proprietary as the product itself. We are not
interested in having our competitors know where we are focusing.
 
Alex Burmann NG Edwards
All right. Thanks.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
I want to comment one more time on that last question. I also don't believe our shareholders who own our shares would be pleased with
me giving away that information because it's not in their best interest either.
 
Joseph To Lehman Brothers
Jack, I missed the beginning of the Q&A. Could you go over the revenue and market guidance. Gross margins.
 
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Gross margins in the 70% area. Revenues will be right now as best we can tell will be flat.
 
Joseph To Lehman Brothers
Okay. Secondarily you guys purchased a bit of capital equipment this quarter. Any specific reason? Cheap or increase capacity or what
was the reason behind that?
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
We actually have, you know, the equipment we are buying is to increase our test capacity, actually. There is growth. The growth are
requiring in different packages. It's been a package evolution. So, we are buying handlers for packages that, you know, we didn't have
enough of. And -- very little, I mean, it's a small number. It's not a strategic issue. There is no news other than that in our capital
purchases.
 
Joseph To Lehman Brothers
All right. Thank you very much.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
I think -- yeah, I think our process technology helps us immensely. Because of what we can do with our process and with the -- it allows
us to use architectures that basically give higher performance than our competitors. The -- these are things like noise slowers, other
things that are sensitivity determining issues. It also allows us to do that and provide a high level of integration. And I think we are clearly
benefiting from that. Having said that, there is definitely a price floor or price ceiling. It is a cost driven market, not driven as much by our
competitors as by the applications. So, you know, I think we have -- I think we have advantages both in performance and I think we have
advances in cost as a result of our process technology and design choices. But I think we also did a good job of recognizing that this was
an area that -- To be in and we began in that area early. And that's always a key thing to do. Mostly deciding what not to do and what to
do. And that's how you win or lose. And, so, we made the best in that area versus other bets we didn't make and I think we will be in good
shape because of it.
 
Tore Svanberg U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
Very well. Would you care to comment on a ballpark number how much your revenue comes from silicon, germanium wafers.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
 or 15%.
 
Tore Svanberg U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
Okay. Very well. Just finally, you know, just based on some of the questions that were asked earlier, comparing with other companies, if
you look at Maxim today, how much would you defined Maxim being pure analog versus mixed signal.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Pure analog less than 10%.
 
Tore Svanberg U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
Excellent. Thank you very much.
 
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
Okay. Yeah, it's not something that has just occurred Clark. It's going on a couple of years, maybe longer. But it is obviously -- it's
something that the distributors have had to do to stay in business, frankly. The conduit manufacturers have said we want this inventory.
We will not be responsible for it. If we don't want it, we can't use it, we will give it back to you. It had a result, we did take an action a year
ago as a result of that, what was going on and what was happening, our distributor, the distributors, I don't blame them for this, but they
have these arrangements with integrated circuit companies which for years to me have been untenable but they would be able to return
inventory that they bought from a semiconductor industry company at -- with no liability. In other words, they could order whatever they
want. If they said I want a million of these parts in my location and be able to return them, the distributor could literally order that from
Texas Instruments or us or ADI and we would build them and ship them and give them to the contract manufacturer and if the contract
manufacturer could only use half of them, he would return the other half and they would then return them back to the semiconductor
company and they are allowed to return 5% what have they buy every quarter. So they could get them all back to the IC company. The
thing that is disastrous about that, these parts, they would buy them in such big quantities, that there wasn't another market for them.
And because Maxim's business is highly proprietary meaning there aren't multiple sources for most of our stuff and this was a really
dangerous situation that was expanding, we developed a policy which is called noncancellable, nonreturn parts. So -- and most of our
product line is that. And it was put together primarily to eliminate that liability for us. In other words, if a distributor buys one of these, he
owns it. If he wants to buy them and give them to a conduct manufacturer and take them back, he can do what he wants to. But he can't
pass on that liability to us.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
We don't actually take any accounting advantage of that, although we could, clearly could. But we just treat all of the inventory with our
distributors as consigned inventory from an accounting point of view and only take as revenue the delta that they ship. But we could, in
fact -- do what you said with you we won't do that.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
That's correct. And they have -- I don't have the exact number, but I think they have return privileges on probably maybe 30%. Less than
half of our product.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
We don't make base end processors. We do.
 
Krishna Shankar JMP Securities, LLC
So other companies with the baseband.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
We do.
 
Krishna Shankar JMP Securities, LLC
Are you shipping the 802.11A and G transceivers and power amplifier in volume now.
 
Jack Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, and CEO
No, not in volume.
 
Krishna Shankar JMP Securities, LLC
Okay. Thank you.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
CONFERENCE CALL PARTICIPANTS
 
Tore Svanberg US Bancorp Piper Jaffray
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Thanks, Carl. I'm going to begin with some prepared remarks and then we'll take your questions. As the press release stated, orders were
up for the company overall 14% from last quarter. And last quarter we indicated that while Maxim's bookings without Dallas were up 4%
for the previous quarter, Dallas bookings were down 10%. For the quarter just ended, Maxim's bookings without Dallas were up 11%, and
we are happy to report that Dallas's bookings were up 22% from the second quarter levels.
Having said that, we would like to see Dallas bookings rise from their current levels of  million a quarter up to over  million a
quarter, and our basis for that desire is that -- prior to our acquisition of Dallas, they had a peak bookings quarter of approximately $200
million. Of that,  million were bookings from their telecome business unit which today is only booking  million per quarter. But as you
can see, netting out the difference, the division should be capable of realizing bookings above their current levels.
Turns orders for the third quarter were $165 million or 54% of net bookings, and we shipped approximately 72% of those terms. The high
percentage of turns orders coupled with continued low cancellations tell us our customers are continuing to order for their immediate
needs. There is no inventory build up with our distributors or customers. In fact, inventories at our distributors have gone down for the
past several quarters.
Breaking out geographic revenue -- our revenue geographically, our bookings for the third quarter were: 35%, the United States, 36% in
the Pac rim; 20% in Europe; and and 9% in Japan, not changed from the previous quarter. Although most of you know, we don't provide
a breakout of our bookings by end mark. I would say the bookings for our power management business units which were more than one
were collectively up 18% over the previous quarter and bookings for the wireless and wire line business units were up 25% and our
standard products business units which are the broad broadest of all in the company were up 17%.
Despite continued U.S. unemployment, demand for Maxim products continues to grow. We attribute the growth to our success in new
product markets, that it required three to four years to penetrate. This penetration of new markets is part of our long-term directions,
most of you know, and we believe that we are on plan.
Bookings for or first four weeks of the fourth quarter are fairly encouraging and running approximately 13% ahead of where they were for
the first four weeks of the last quarter, but we are not jumping to any conclusions based on four weeks of data which typically, you know,
could not be representative of the quarter. But we don't have to sustain that right either to have a good fourth quarter. We currently plan
for revenues to increase sequentially in this fourth quarter with a penny increase in earnings per share to  cents a share. But I'm going
to wait -- we're going to wait until we are further into the fourth quarter to be more specific about revenue growth. Our current plan
depends on our booking and shipping about $110 million of turns orders during this quarter.
We would like to begin building backlog so we are not as dependant on turns as we have been in the past couple quarters, and we did
some of that last quarter. We would like to go forward with that plan. Historically, Maxim's quarterly revenues have been derived from
shipping less than 40% of its turns orders. As I commented earlier, last quarter we shipped over 70% of our turns orders.
 
Gross margins for the company overall were 69.9%, up slightly from the second quarter gross margin. The increases were due to product
mix and manufacturing efficiencies we realized during the quarter. We very proud of the improvement of Dallas Semiconductors' gross
margin over the past several quarters. And this quarter, Dallas Semiconductors' gross margin continued to increased about a half a
percent to 63.2%. This is higher than almost all semiconductor companies. We have continued to make progress reducing on shore costs
at Dallas. We have almost finished moving all of their end-of-line operations offshore to the Philippines. During this quarter, Dallas costs
will continue to go down as a result of continued moves offshore, conversion to 8-inch wafers and improvements across the board in
manufacturing yields.
Operating margins for the corporation were 39.2% of net revenues. As we have stated before, we are continuing to work toward our goal
of achieving a below-the-line spending level of 25% of revenues. This will come primarily as a result of revenues increasing. Although
R&D spending was down slightly in the third quarter, we did add  development engineers and plan to add another  development
engineers in the quarter we are in. Generally speaking, we have not seen any real degradation in average selling price over -- and we
attribute that almost entirely to the fact that our products are -- an overwhelming majority of our products are proprietary and owned by
Maxim.
During the quarter, we generated $11 million of cash after spending $20 million to repurchase 650,000 shares of stock. By most
standards, our consistent cash generation has been and continues to be very impressive. Based on our profitability and our outlook and
our need for cash, the board has voted to increase the quarterly dividend from  cents a share to  cents a share as Carl pointed out.
During the quarter we introduced  engineering man-month of products in the quarter that ended April 26th, and this is compared to
 engineering man-months of new products introduced during the quarter. Many of you know now that we are measuring our
productivity, our product development efforts in terms of the man-months contained with a product, as it is a better account for the
increase and variability in the product complexity.
New products continue to be extremely well accepted in this marketplace. This quarter, we had important design winds in the latest
generation of notebook computers, in 02.11 wireless lands, cellular handsets, portable medical devices, high speed data networks,
security equipment and other areas. Our fiber business unit is continuing to diversify their direction into high speed applications and they
are also experiencing -- beginning to experience revenue increases in the -- primarily in the data com area.
Talking now about manufacturing, our conversion of processes to 8-inch wafers in our fabs in San Jose and Dallas are proceeding
approximately on schedule. Dallas is behind a little bit but San Jose is on schedule. The conversion to 8-inch wafers at our San Jose fab is
complete, and if demand allows, we will shutdown the 6-inch production over the next several quarters. At our Dallas fab, we are
running qualification lots and planning to ramp 8-inch production over the next several quarters. While we are doing this, we are
incurring approximately a million and a half dollalrs a quarter of R&D expense. We have over the last couple quarters and it will continue
until the qualification is completed.
By end of fiscal  which would be beginning of -- well, beginning this quarter, a year from now, the company will be shipping 45% of its
revenue on 8-inch wafers. Our three wafer fabs are running today at about 55% capacity. We currently have a capacity in place,
equipment and facilities to ship over $500 million dollars per quarter. We are shipping approximately  million per quarter. With
additional equipment in our existing facilities, we could ship approximately $1.2 billion per quarter. This increase -- these increases in
output would obviously further reduce our manufacturing costs.
Although we had hoped to increase our inventory slightly in the third quarter, our inventories actually fell $4.2 million. Our plan for the
fourth quarter is to increase manufacturing output above third quarter levels to support our expected increase in demand. During the
fourth quarter, we expect to purchase land in Thailand in which we will build a new end-of-line facility, but construction will begin this
quarter and end by fiscal -- by the end of fiscal '04. At that time, we will be able to ship approximately half of our production from that
facility. We currently ship about 28% of our product from a manufacturing facility that we in Thailand, that is on -- in a leased building.
Some one of you will probably ask something about SARS and its affect on Maxim. We have no fab or test facilities or manufacturing
 
facilities in China. Therefore, we are not going to be affected.
I would like to talk a bit about stock option expensing if you will allow me. In Maxim's view on the possibility of new regulations that
could impact effectiveness of many technology companies and, therefore, the growth of our economy in the United States. We are
opposed to the expensing of stock options and stock option expense regulations currently under review, and we are opposed on two
fronts. First, it is bad accounting, pure and simple. Secondly, we strongly believe that if these regulations are put in place they could
severely damage the U.S. leadership position over other countries regarding technology innovation.
The United States has attracted the best talent from all over the world because -- through options, shareholders have been able --
entrepreneurs and employers to share in the success of their companies. We are at risk of weakening the tremendous employee
commitment that has successfully fueled our U.S. competitive advantage. The potential damaging long-term affect of our nation -- on
our nation's economy and our lifestyle that would result from the force expensing of stock options should be taken very seriously.
Maxim has always obtained stockholder, shareholder approval for our employee stock options. And our shareholders have approved our
plan each year for the last  years. They have approved our plan because the company has performed well for them as shareholders.
And this partnership has been in place, you know, since almost the beginning of our company. We totally support making stockholder
approval of stock option plans mandatory. We also strongly disagree with the effort being made to expense stock options. With that, I'll
open the call to questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Yeah. I commented on that. Our company runs much better if we're only requiring to turn  or 40% of our available turns in on a given
financial period. So we would like to not be having to turn 70% of what we book for turns or ship 70% of what we book for turns during
the quarters. So that's -- to use your phrase that's kind of what's behind it.
 
Tore Svanberg US Bancorp Piper Jaffray
Very well. And 14% increase in bookings, can you talk a little about some of the areas of strength that drove that level?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Yeah. We were -- we had strong bookings in virtually every -- every business area. I think  of our  business units had increases of over
10% quarter over quarter and I think  of them had increases of maybe as much as 20% quarter over quarter. I don't remember the
number exactly. We only had one business unit that did not have increases, and that was the basically in the ATE area. But other than
that, we saw growth everywhere. Fiber -- you know, I'm comfortable or I feel a lot better about their direction and they are beginning
actually to have growth again.
 
Tore Svanberg US Bancorp Piper Jaffray
Okay. Very well. And finally, I think last quarter you indicated that about 15% of your wafers were silicon-germanium based. Is that
primarily for own internal production or does some of that include foundry services as well?
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Yeah, there is a small amount for foundry services. But you're right, Tore. We do provide a servoce like TSMC, and like IBM. We have
technologies others don't have. And we do offer it to our -- in customers to do designs with. But it is not a material number.
 
Tore Svanberg US Bancorp Piper Jaffray
Excellent. Thank you.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Well, Michael, thank you for your nice comment about the company, but I want to make sure based on your question I want to make sure
I didn't confuse people. I said we needed to ship for turns  million. But like as you know or as you may know we did turn last quarter,
and, in fact, for the last couple quarters we booked for turns over $160 million or $164 million last quarter which was a record quarter. I
think we have to go back almost two years where we found a quarter where we booked for turns as much as we did last quarter. It was a
very -- you know, it was a positive quarter. And my  million number was simply a number that if we, you know, that we are now looking
at as a drop dead low number that we would need to turn to ship an acceptable number. I also commented that we don't have a revenue
plan finalized yet for the quarter. We want to see how the quarter goes forward before we finalize that.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
It's in.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
We will actually get a -- excuse me. Carl is collecting me.. There is a little increase. Maybe you want to comment on that?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I think the net result is not much -- whatever. If you need the number we'll give it to you. It is not a material number.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
One thing that will come off. I mean, we're spending a million and a half for expense to qualities processes. So that will stop -- sometime
during the year.
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
None. No further correspondence. Our position has not changed.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Well, lead times moving out is a negative issue. You know, they come about because customers place orders on you that you don't
anticipate. You know, when your turns orders are as high as ours are now, people are very much in jeopardy of having lead time
problems. Because on average our lead times haven't moved out. There have been areas where they clearly have because of these
accelerated, unpredicted and unplanned booking levels.
 
Ross Seymour Deutsche Bank
Okay. So you think that will be more the disruptions of the supply chain that will bring it up quicker than just an over all increase in
demand these days?.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Well, it is the increase in demand that brings it up. It is the fact that customers are operate -- it is amplified by the fact that customers are
number one, don't have as good a visibility in long term -- their changes -- change is in demand and demand changes occur to them --
occur on them -- occur to them, excuse me -- without a lot of visibility. So I believe as I commented last quarter, I think that's happening
more often now than it has in the past. They aren't having to react and they can't see very far ahead and I think they are -- they are seeing
increases and changes in demand, and I think the other thing that's maybe causing their -- the high level of turns that we're getting is
that they, again, still are trying to not end up with obsolete inventory, and they want to control their inventory levels in their spending.
But I think the two together do result in disruption and longer lead times, and I think you are going to see these disruptions. You know,
they are occurring -- they are occurring now. You just don't see them in the overall numbers.
 
 
Ross Seymour Deutsche Bank
Okay. And One follow-up on the other side of your wireless business, the wireless land business. You have some good traction in the B
market, specifically with your radio. And I wanted to see two things -- one, the pricing in that market, have you noticed material changes
there? And the second point, with that market in general moving over to 802.11G in a little bit more volumes, do you have that in the road
map and product to be introduced anytime soon?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Yeah, I think -- as I have seed before, anytime you sell products into a regulated product description, you can expect a blood bath. And
we went into the business knowing we were going to have to be the low cost producer and we are. And it is not one of our high profit
margin areas, but we obviously planned for that. So, you know, there has been price attrition which certainly we anticipated and are
comfortable with, and the G business is one that we intend to be a leader in that particular 802.11 arena with regard to all the variety.
 
Ross Seymour Deutsche Bank
Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I don't know the answer to that question on this phone call.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I don't look at it as a negative toward Maxim. I think Dallas has the potential to do very well. We wouldn't have bought the company if we
didn't see the potential in the people and the proprietary product lines and the technologies that are proprietary, and its breadth as I
tried to point out. They actually had the potential to book a couple hundred million per quarter, and they have done that. I am
disappointed-- we are all disappointed that they were hammered so badly during this downturn. But we're not surprised -- would not be
surprised for them to do materially better than they are doing.
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
That was -- like I pointed out, that was an abberation and it was not a strategic issue then or now.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
We actually did not achieve our objective of increasing our moves to the level I reported we were going to try to do, you know, at the last
conference call. We increased them and I don't have the numbers at my finger tips. Sorry about that. I can give them to you later. But we
-- had we -- had we achieved the moves increase we planned on, we would not have built the -- we would not have reduced our
inventories all of the $4 million.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
The fab moves?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I have the number, but, you know, I'm going to be guessing if I try to remember it.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I don't have it in front of me. I'll have to give it to you off of this call. Okay?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Call me.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
As to whether or not gross margins will increase or in terms of what we report in Q4?
 
Brian Wu Bear Stearns & Company
Yeah, is that a possibility?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I would expect that we my see -- we might see a couple of basis points or something, you know. It is a slow process but we're not -- you
know, as we get toward  or 80% utililization, it would be a material number, and I think as Dallas gross margins continue to increase it
will be material, but you are not going to see a material affect in Q4. You will see it maybe -- I mean, it will be flat to up slightly gross
margins.
 
Brian Wu Bear Stearns & Company
Okay. And follow-up, with you guys not giving sequential revenue guidance today, does that imply you might be holding a mid-quarter
update sometime during this quarter?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
It definitely implies that as soon as we know for sure what the revenue -- what we're going to ship, we will communicate it. We haven't
yet. It is just too early in the quarter. And we had a big -- we have had two quarters of big booking screw-ups. We went from  million
to --  million to  million and now we're up to  million bookings. I want to see the slope of the line first. I want to see what
happens this quarter before I write in stone some sort of a revenue number.
 
 
Brian Wu Bear Stearns & Company
Okay. Thanks a lot.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Actually it is more product oriented than macro economically oriented. I think relative to your point -- your question though. In the metro,
the telecom segment, we are -- the inventory situation has been pretty well corrected, and I think there is some buying there, you know,
of telecom-related fiber products. In the datacom area, you have a different scenario altogether. There never really has been an inventory
problem. As you may know, the datacom market has -- the datacom products from a performance point of view have gotten very fast,
and they really do need fiber connections on their back planes. And we have been, you know somewhat innovative in these areas, so our
new products are enjoying some success in new equipments. That's really what we're seeing there. But I think it is a long-term positive
trend and you will see the value of fiber products and the datacom market continue to increase.
 
Christopher Caso SoundView Technology Group
Okay. Great. Just a follow-up. Maybe you can comment about the impact of Intel [Centrino] launch on your notebook revenues. I know
have you a good share there. If you could talk about it perhaps in what you saw, you know, benefit from [Centrino] units and extra
contents in [Centrino] during the quarter.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I mean, you are asking me a question about whether Intel sales -- notebook sales will increase because of the wireless connection, aren't
you?
 
Christopher Caso SoundView Technology Group
Well, maybe you could put it in terms of -- you know, what changes for Maxim as you go from P4 notebooks to [Centrino] notebooks in
terms of maximum content. Maybe you can put it that way.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I don't think [Centrino] by itself, other than the radio helps our revenue cross-section in the notebook market. I think the notebook market
-- we're gaining content because we're -- in the notebook, because we are doing a load of functions that we weren't doing. The [Centrino]
idea is going to help our wireless product sales because all old and new notebooks are probably going to have a wireless connection, but
I think probably we're going to get more benefit from the after-market sale of notebook -- of radios than -- you know, I guess I'm a little
presumptuous here with to be commenting on what Intel has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to figure out, and that's whether or
not a wireless notebook is going to increase the sales of -- the overall annual sales of notebooks. I would rather them answer that
question than me. I don't build notebooks. My opinion and yours would be about equally weighted there.
 
Christopher Caso SoundView Technology Group
Okay. Sure. Safe to say as far as your content and perhaps some increase due to wireless content but --
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I think, clearly, it will increase. But this is not because of [Centrino]. We believe that the notebook is a more useful tool if it is wireless
connected. People have been selling notebooks with slots for wireless cars for well over a year. And I think, you know, if you take a look at
the install base of notebook, they are all a potential to be made wireless, right?
 
 
Christopher Caso SoundView Technology Group
Sure. Sure.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
And so that's got to help sales of radios and people who make components that go into radios should benefit from that.
 
Christopher Caso SoundView Technology Group
Okay. Thank you.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Yeah, he was speaking of Japan. In our press release we said that our bookings were up in all markets except Japan. They were down
which is accurate also, but that included -- those were our distributor orders on Maxim for Japan. But if you look at customers in Japan
big Maxim products for our distributors they were up. But the Japanese distributors didn't order from us.
 
Brian Wu Bear Stearns & Company
I see. Okay.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
We wanted to clarify that because -- for the reasons you are asking, actually.
 
Brian Wu Bear Stearns & Company
Jack, the -- we have been in these environment so long, I was wondering whether its going back to the original Maxim model where you
only ship 40% of the turns orders you get. Is viable until you have much higher operating rates. I know you like to have visibility.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
We will go to 70% to 40% in one quarter. I agree with you. That is not realistic. But clearly a Maxim would run -- I mean, we're going to
operate better if we can move that number down as reasonably as we can.
 
Brian Wu Bear Stearns & Company
Uh-huh. Jack, based on what you see out there --
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
let me make one more comment on that, David. It would not be in our best interest to create delinquencies in order to do it. We're not
going to do something stupid.
 
Brian Wu Bear Stearns & Company
Okay. Jack, if you look at your total end markets, if ten of your  business units have bookings north of 10%, other than those two
business units of Dallas in the past -- making up past strengths, would you say that the breadth of your recovery of your bookings right
now leads to you to suspect maybe the -- your customers are more optimistic than what they are telling investors in the conference calls?
I would think the bookings are more realistic -- it's like their expectation of the June quarter as opposed to what they officially guide to
the street.
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I think we are in the early quarters of seeing some healthy growth. I think their being conservative is probably -- I think they are being
reasonable. I don't think they are euphoric. You have to remember that what you're probably seeing now, and as a general statement, is
you're probably seeing business as normal. I mean, inventories have been depleted and what you are seeing now is true consumption. I
think you are also seeing companies change pecking orders, places on the pecking order list by having to do with which companies have
got their products designed into the new generations of -- well, a theoretical example, I don't want to you run back and say Jack said
we're dominating SISCO, but to use SISCO as an example, SISCO's new generation equipment may have a higher percentage of Maxim
products than the old generation. The pecking order's changed. That's truly a theoretical example. But that can cause some companies
to have growth in -- with just normal -- you know, normal market growth now which I think is still embryonic. But maybe you will see
some of that. But I would not -- you know, unemployment is high. We still have got -- I mean, consumer confidence has to get -- has to
improve. When that starts to happen you will see more growth, but I think you will see companies that have higher growth rates than
others primarily because their new products have shown up and have gotten into the new generation of equipments and other company's
products haven't.
 
Brian Wu Bear Stearns & Company
Okay. Thank you.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I think there is no doubt we are benefitting from things we did three years ago. We have gotten ourselves into equipment we weren't in,
and we have had a big jump -- I think we have had about a 20% jump compounded -- and I may be wrong on this number, but it is in the
ballpark of 20% over the last three years, increase in engineering man-months introduced. Largely, as a result of ,-- we acquired a lot of
man-months from Dallas. We had a huge influx of engineering effort. We've been able to invest over the last -- in the last  1/2 years. It
has to help. It can't hurt. I think that's a fair assessment.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
If you let time pass by -- I have  years experience in this business. If you have a period where people are burning off inventory or
equipment sales have slowed down -- you can be in a design -- you can be in a generation of equipment and never sell anything. When
business starts up again, your customer is starting to ship a new generation of product and you are out of it. So you can miss a family of
products, can miss a whole generation if there is no demand for your product at the time. They don't just sit there with the old design for
four years, you know, waiting -- they design a new generation. I don't know if I made myself clear.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Well, I think people are going to miss a major portions of a product cycle, yeah, I really do. I think enough time has gone by, what, two
years? I think there will be some of that, for sure.
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I mean, I may be an optimist and obviously I am biased, but I think we will benefit from that.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Sure, you can. I would rather do it without tieing everybody up here, -- okay. But price per product is increasing. Complexities are
increasing. I tried to allude to that. We have this huge inventory of man-months lost and then waiting to announce. So it is not a real nice
smooth number. But I would be happy to -- I mean, relative to our long-range plan and generally that being on tack, we feel we are on
plan. Relative to the products we needed to announce and launch and what we have launched and announced.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Yeah. We can. Let me just see if I can get to it. Okay. Quarter over quarter -- Carl, catch me if I get one of these wrong. The U.S. is up 8%,
right?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
9%. Oh, I've got the wrong end market book, is that right? What is that?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Oh, that's dollars. Okay. The U.S. is up 9%, Europe up 16, Japan is 5, Pac rim is 12.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Yeah, I said our business units have -- I have to interrupt, I didn't get to finish my sentence. I said our business units, you know, have
demonstrated a more optimistic view of consumption. Their projections for the fourth quarter consumption of our product is up from
what they projected, you know, a quarter ago and they are projecting currently it is over -- it is over  million, and if you go back, you
know, a quarter, a little longer than a quarter and they were projecting something in the neighborhood of  million. So they are more
optimistic now than four months ago.
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
That's an altruistic number. I don't know what a good use of the word is. That's a consumption number of that one I gave you, the one
north of 320. They believe that's what is going into equipment.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Inventory -- in general inventory. Distributors' inventories or their own inventory.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
That is a good question. That's a great question, and I'm going to find that out. I don't know the answer to that. I will analyze that. I
would tell you if I knew. I hadn't even thought to look at that. We should.
 
Casey [INAUDIBLE] Semiequity Capital
Another question is on the management business. Do you see a lot of competition from Tiawanese, and can you comment on your gross
margin going forward in this business?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Power management, it is a very broad field. I mean, if you looked at LTC, they call -- I mean, they sell mostly power management but
they break it into-- they call their communications business -- they call our power management business in communications,
communications. It is wherever you are selling a power supply related product, that kind of equipment. You know, that's what that is.
And we -- I would say that we're, you know, we're having -- we're doing well in that area, we're penetrating new markets and we're doing
more than holding our own in the existing markets. I mean, there are some businesses -- account by account, we could be losing designs,
but overall we are gaining market share and power management.
 
Casey [INAUDIBLE] Semiequity Capital
What about in the desk top?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
We're not in the desk top at all. That's the one area we are not in.
 
Casey [INAUDIBLE] Semiequity Capital
And what about notebook?
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
We are big in notebook and we have -- we have between  and 70% of the markets, you know for -- you know for -- well, for the
products we have, I mean, we have large market shares in, you know, in each -- for each of the products. There are maybe as many as
seven different segments of about -- in a notebook.
 
Casey [INAUDIBLE] Semiequity Capital
Okay.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
But I could be wrong in that number  too. So don't hold me to that. And I do know that we have lost market share in one area, but we
gained market share in several others. I know overall we have gained market share.
 
Casey [INAUDIBLE] Semiequity Capital
Okay. Good quarter, guys. Thank you.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
You know, -- that's a good question. I would -- stock options got us here. I would be a fool to change our corporate business strategy. I
believe what's going on is a political witch hunt. I believe it is illogical. I am going to completely ignore it. We are going to run our
company as our shareholders have told us to. And as we do, we're going to continue to issue stock options. Maxim generates -- we
basically could go -- do a pro forma cash accounting and you couldn't tell the difference. I mean, when we make $100 million of profit
you could look in the box and find a $100 million in cash in Maxim. Regardless of what they do, we're going to continue to issue stock
options and we're going to report both our -- if we're required to report expensing options we're going do that, and we'll report pro forma
cash accounting. I'm confident that fund managers and people who manage money will -- they have already concluded that for them to
determine how a company is doing they will have to look at the cash accounting and subtract out all these other ridiculous things. So,
long answer to your question, but it won't change how we operate a bit.
 
David Einhorn Greenlight Capital
So then, I don't understand the -- if you are not worried about the earnings impact and the stock price impact from the options, what
exactly then do you see as the threat to the nation's economy lifestyle?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
If other companies are panics by this, and don't have the wisdom, the experience and they do short sheet their employees, and what
caused them to grow, and they underestimate, you know, how important that commitment on the part of the company is to their
employees are, what that will do to them. I am not worried about Maxim one bit. I think it can hurt the country terribly and it can level the
playing field which Europe would love to have happen if companies have a knee jerk reaction. And try to run to a drummer that doesn't
make any sense. It is more senseless in my opinion than companies trying to run their business in order to accomodate analysts --
quarterly report and estimations of what you are going to do quarter to quarter. If you run your company trying to do that you can't run it
well either. And we will not change how we run our company, and I hope others won't either. My editorial had to do with trying to sound a
bell for them to not -- to ignore these also, but we're going to ignore it.
 
David Einhorn Greenlight Capital
Great. Thanks so much.
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I'm sorry, would you start that over?
 
Krishna Shankar JMP Securities
I want to get a strength of the booking strength and newer products versus, you know, quote, unquote, old products, to what extent are
we recovering bookings for all the products versus a products design in the last two years?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Well, you know, it is impossible to answer that question. Obviously, our new products have to succeed our older ones in new markets or
we can't meet our plan. Our plans are dependant on that. I mean our older products atrophy out over a five to eight year period. The
answer is -- the general answer to your general question is our new products are succeeding them and penetrating new -- not only new
designs, but new markets and we have a plan that does require that to happen.
 
Krishna Shankar JMP Securities
Okay. Thank you.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Which quarter? The quarter we were just in, just finished?
 
Parish Maneer Premier Financial
Yeah, the one we just finished, the December quarter.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Well, would you have to take -- we had to ship 70% of our turns in order to do that, so does that answer your question?
 
Parish Maneer Premier Financial
Was it a conscious choice made by the management not to increase shipments?.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I think those of with you operational experience will realize that it is very difficult to be trying to ship more than 70% of what you turn or
80%. It is chaos, so you don't want to be in a position where you are having to react to turns much higher than that. So obviously it was a
conscious management decision, yeah.
 
Parish Maneer Premier Financial
Okay. That's what I wanted to know. And it wasn't a matter of not having the right mix, it was a matter of conscience, management
position.
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Well, it is a combination of things. There was a segment of turns we couldn't ship because the orders came in, you know, out of mix. I
mean, there is some of that too. But I think -- we feel good that -- you know, we planned to ship 70% of our turns and we shipped 70% of
our turns and I think we're more comfortable shipping a lower percentage of turns.
 
Parish Maneer Premier Financial
Thank you.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
You will have to explain to me what you mean.
 
Tom Thornhill UBS Warburg
Multiple -- products where you are putting, say, DC to DC convertors in [INAUDIBLE] perhaps, and on a single substrate, or multiple
LDLs on a single substrate versus the the traditional analog building products.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Okay. You mean an analog being like it is an amplifier or comparitor or reference, a single function, is that what you are talking about?
Both being monolithic
 
Tom Thornhill UBS Warburg
That's correct. I'm asking if we're seeing more growth in the more integrated products.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Yeah, I think somebody asked a question similar to that a few quarters ago. They were surprised by the answer. But, we -- yeah, at
Maxim, we call ourselves a mixed signal company. And that means a couple things. It means, number one, a large percentage of the -- of
the electronics on a -- on our microchips is actually digital. Probably on average I would say that maybe 60% of the content of any -- on
average of a Maxim product is digital. As far as having multiple functions that are either digital or analog, I would say that somewhere in
the neighborhood of final 95% of our products, our revenues come from product that's have -- that are what you called multiple
functions, you know, integrated where they are doing, you know, LDO's or combinations of microcontrollers and A to D converters. We
have very little business that is pure analog.
 
Tom Thornhill UBS Warburg
Understood. Another company introduced a single-chip DSL product in the last few days integrating line drivers and power management
into this, all -- the whole product into a single piece of silicon. Does this product threaten to change the demand for the power
management functions or those sockets over time or is this a small event?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
No, I think it is a natural progression. I think that -- I don't know the product you are talking about, but in some -- that could make sense.
I mean, it depends on the partitioning of the customer and whether the voltages ranges allow it and -- but, there are some things that
don't make sense to integrate, but that could make good sense. I can't tell without knowing more.
 
Tom Thornhill UBS Warburg
Thank you.
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Not if I have a choice? No, I mean, historically if we go back through the many years, I think we average closer to 35% turns.
 
Matthew Chan Merrill Lynch
I'm sorry. I wasn't referring to turns business. You said you shipped 70% of -- of the turns orders that you got you only shipped 70% of
that?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Yes, that's what I just answered. What did -- yeah, I said historically we have not shipped probably more than 35% of the orders we have
got for turns in a given quarter. 70% is one of the higher numbers we have shipped.
 
Matthew Chan Merrill Lynch
Right. Right. And going back to that  million figure you gave us earlier. It seems through listening to a couple earlier questions that
that's really kind of your bottom line threshold, the minimum amount of turns you expect in this quarter. Am I interpreting that correctly?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I can understand how I have confused you. That's a number that we would need to turn -- to ship for -- from our turns to meet a
minimally acceptable number. I think that's what you just said, actually.
 
Matthew Chan Merrill Lynch
Okay. Great. That answers my question. Thanks for the bookings break down. I was wondering, I know you don't typically provide sales
breakdowns, could you tell us what was your best performing business in terms of sales? And perhaps what the worst performing
business in terms of sales in the just-ended March quarter was?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
The worst performing is the ATE business. A lot are doing well. Every business unit had bookings up. I don't want to pick any favorites.
I'm obviously much more pleased this quarter than I was six months ago. But, yeah, I think things are on a definite uptick.
 
Matthew Chan Merrill Lynch
Finally, turning to gross margins, how much gross margin upside do you think we have here? We have a couple things happening and
you are moving more to 8-inch manufacturing and you probably still have more room in the Dallas business for gross margin expansion.
Perhaps, if you can offer a longer term outlook here?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Well, our longer term outlook is in the low 60s over four or five years. We expect to be, you know, our gross margins will be in the low
60s. But, you know, in the short-term, we see nothing that's going to erode our margins, you know, below the current levels.
 
Matthew Chan Merrill Lynch
But do you see gross margins expanding further?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Well, you know,, obviously they will when we get manufacturing efficiencies, but, you know, there is a blending going on because we are
entering markets that have got great profit growth opportunities for us that to be in them you need to be comfortable with you know,
55% gross margins. We have a blending going on. It is not a parameter we use to run this company. People mostly understand that now.
 
 
Matthew Chan Merrill Lynch
So, what I'm hearing is perhaps there is some upside due to manufacturing, but, over the long run, if you are going to grow revenues you
have to enter new markets where have you to accept lower margins?.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
We know if we're going to produce 30% gross in profits, gross in profits year over year after the long-term, you've got to grow revenues.
And it is -- it is much -- it is a safer business strategy to grow revenues than to try and optimize gross margins.
 
Matthew Chan Merrill Lynch
Okay. Thank you.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I would like to know -- I would like more time to pass. We're seeing, you know, changes in the environment, and I would like to watch it.
 
Gregory Calleri Midwest Research
Okay. So, even though you got a good view and bookings are up, there is something out there that is still causing you some concern here.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Concern? No. I'm euphoric. I mean, I was -- no, I'm actually in one of my more euphoric moods. I'm not concerned. I mean, I don't want to
put, you know, something down that I don't -- you know, that I don't feel like I need to do right now. It is not very important right now for
me to guess at a number. I want to -- you know, I know we're going earn -- our bookings will be up and we'll earn more money than we
did last quarter, and that's really all I what president to talk about right now. We don't have the backlog to say a lot more. I only have
$200 million in backlog shippable in the quarter. I mean, I'm really -- we're not where we want to be. We would much rather have a
higher backlog in the next  days.
 
Gregory Calleri Midwest Research
I understand.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
And not to have to ship, you know --
 
Gregory Calleri Midwest Research
but you have given guidance with less backlog in the past.
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Have I given guidance, not really. I really haven't. I have given minimum numbers which I have basically given here. I mean, I have given
what I know we can do.
 
Gregory Calleri Midwest Research
Okay. And you had talked about a little bit of weakness in your test business. Do you think that's just people burning through inventory, a
pause here? Can you give us a little more color on that part of business?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
The semiconductor equipment companies, wafer fab and test equipment just aren't getting orders, yet. There has to be -- I think the test
equipment guys will start to get orders before the fab guys, but that could be imminent, frankly. Unit demand is up and you can't -- you
know, you can't build the stuff without testing it. The problem is there was a lot of equipment sold -- you know, when everything peeked
about two years ago. A lot of that equipment is useful. They are not selling equipment.
 
Gregory Calleri Midwest Research
Okay. And then you talked about no inventory at your distributors or your end customers, but that's about as far as you can see. You
wouldn't know stuff was building in finished goods?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
No, I think I would.
 
Gregory Calleri Midwest Research
So you believe everything is pretty clean out there, all the way through to the end customer. Being the consumer for PC's or cell phones
or whatever?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Well, I'm sure there is some consumer product that is just -- the stuff is coming out the windows and it is over inventoryed. Don't nail me
to that cross.
 
Gregory Calleri Midwest Research
I'm not trying to pin you down on one. I'm trying to get a sense of how far you can see.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Yes, I agree. I said that in the press release and I think I said it in my comments that we think the inventories are very healthy out there.
Low.
 
Gregory Calleri Midwest Research
Okay. Thank you for your time.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
We don't -- with four weeks gone by, we haven't analyzed -- I couldn't tell you where those bookings were coming from right now. But we
don't pay a lot of attention to what's happened after four weeks other than the fact that if nothing, if we book nothing we get panicked.
But so far the quarter is ahead of last quarter and if I -- and I -- our wireless -- I know qualitatively that -- where it is up and at least for
 
four -- in the early part of the quarter I mean, it is up and the wireless business is up, you know, over where it was last quarter. You know,
the fiber use business is up and our notebook business is up over last quarter. I know those things. Our telecom business was up, but it
was aat such a terrible low, it is up, but up materially. These things don't mean a lot after four weeks. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
 
Clark Fuseman Fulcrum Partners
All right. On the $100 million booking target from Dallas -- actually, one small one before that. You said that the end demand in your
markets for the upcoming quarter was in excess of $320 million. Do you think that's about where the bookings level is going to wind up,
or do you think bookings will be up in the quarter, you know, or they are so far in the quarter, it is hard to judge, but do you think they will
end up being up?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Well, you know, remember this consumption number we have in infinite detail comes from human beings that live or die by trying to
guess at what their customers are telling them, what's going to happen. And they have emotions and they go from pessimistic to
optimistic. Like I tried to point out, they change their optimism from  million-dollar number four months ago to a number in excess of
320. A lot of it had to do with they were hearing more optimistic stuff. The people who project the bookings, this is a consumption
booking number -- the people that project the bookings, they pick a number, you know, that's a little lower than the guy who projects the
consumption, but still it is in the $320 million range. One is  and one is 327. But remember, they are just groups of people that we add
their projections up and it is affected by emotion. And optimism and pessimism. They talk to customers. They believe them, but they are
biased by what happened the previous quarter?
 
Clark Fuseman Fulcrum Partners
Great. And specifically to Dallas on that $100 million target on bookings, obviously you won't get there in one quarter. We would love to
see it, but you're not goint to get there.. What is your time horizon on that? Is is that over the course of the next the four quarters or
something sooner than that?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I would -- yeah, I think -- I just don't know. We don't have -- I will tell you this: We do not have demand projections for them to be over a
 million in the next quarter. That's not there. I didn't mean to imply that.
 
Clark Fuseman Fulcrum Partners
No. No. No. You didn't.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
The potential is clearly there for them to book over a  million. It could happen later. I just can't tell you right now.
 
Clark Fuseman Fulcrum Partners
Great.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
We have new businesses there that will help us when they kick in. And one is this microcontroller business. But I didn't mean to imply
that next quarter we will book  million in Dallas.
 
Clark Fuseman Fulcrum Partners
No, you didn't do that. but thanks for that. The one -- one little housekeeping question, modeling question. What do you expect out backs
to do in the fourth quarter? flatish? down a little? up a little?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
What parameter? Which one?
 
Clark Fuseman Fulcrum Partners
Operating expenses.
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Below the line? Is that what you mean, below the line expenses?.
 
Clark Fuseman Fulcrum Partners
Yeah. R&B, SG&A.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
We will add  or  people. We're going to basically increase operating expenses as we grow revenues, but with the control that our
primary objective is to try and get in some -- as we grow revenue to get that as a percentage of sales, you know, closer -- closer to 25%. It
will be controlled. It will go up maybe a million dollars. I'm really guessing. I mean, it won't be flat. But it won't -- it will not certainly track
revenue growth.
 
Clark Fuseman Fulcrum Partners
Great. So up a little is the operative word here.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Yeah. We remember -- remember, we have enough people -- enough technical people in place which we have had for over two years to
execute our long-range plan. We're not having to manipulate it to grow into it -- to hire people to grow into it anyway, frankly, but we are
not on a treadmill to need those people. That was a result of the  -- or  product development people we acquired with Dallas. So
that's actually -- you know, that put us in a comfortable position. We would like -- you know, as I have said, we believe our below-the-line
expense of percentage of sales is too high right now. But we need to grow into it. But we have been able to benefit by having these
people and having that expense for the last two years. We got something for it. So it has been a good investment, but it hasn't made our
numbers as nice as we would like them to have. But we're going to get the benefit of having that 35% below-the-line spending we have
had for the last two years.
 
Clark Fuseman Fulcrum Partners
Great. Thanks.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Tore, I really can't. I don't want to comment on your model. I just don't want to do that.
 
Tore Svanberg US Bancorp Piper Jaffray
A second follow-up. What is your current bookings run rate?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Sorry, what?
 
Tore Svanberg US Bancorp Piper Jaffray
Your current bookings run rate?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
What is that? I'm not sure I know your question. What do you mean by current bookings run rate?
 
 
Tore Svanberg US Bancorp Piper Jaffray
Where you stand today, what is the run rate?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
What have we booked to date?
 
Tore Svanberg US Bancorp Piper Jaffray
Your run rate for the next  days?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Well, -- if we -- you mean if you take a linear extrapolation of what we've booked to date?
 
Tore Svanberg US Bancorp Piper Jaffray
Yes, exactly.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
You can do that as well as I can. About $330 million.
 
Tore Svanberg US Bancorp Piper Jaffray
Great. Thank you.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Thank you, operator. This does conclude Maxim's conference call. We want to thank you for your continued participation and interest in
Maxim. Thank you.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
CONFERENCE CALL PARTICIPANTS
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Thanks, Carl.
We will begin, as usual, with some prepared remarks and then take whatever questions you would like to ask and provide you our best
answers. The fourth quarter bookings were up approximately $5 million from the last quarter, and for the year, our bookings for the
corporation were up 11% year-over-year. For Maxim without Dallas, our bookings were up 15% year-over-year, and Dallas's bookings
without Maxim included were flat year-over-year. We do expect Dallas bookings to improve over the next few quarters. Turns orders for
the fourth quarter were approximately  million, or 51% of our net bookings, and turns orders continue to be high relative to historical
levels, which indicate to us that our customers are still ordering for their immediate needs. Turns orders have been about half of our
bookings since the beginning of fiscal '02 when our bookings were at their lowest level.
Inventories remained low at both our customers and our distributors worldwide. The geographic break-out of our bookings for fourth
quarter were 34% in the United States, 37% in the Pac Rim, 20% in Europe, and 9% in Japan. And year-over-year, the growth came 9%
from the U.S., 12% in the Pac Rim, Europe was up 10%, and Japan bookings were up 15%. Although we don't break out comprehensively
our bookings by product market, I will tell you that we would highlight that this last quarter our business unit, or, excuse me, our data
convertor business unit had increased bookings of 23% over the previous quarter, and our wireless and our wire line telecom business
units, communications business units, bookings were up 22% quarter-over-quarter.
Bookings for this current quarter, Q1, are going according to plan, in fact. We are through the first six weeks booking at a pace of
approximately $350 million for the quarter. Our ship demand projections from our business units say that consumption -- projected
consumption, will be in the neighborhood of about $330 million. Based on that, we currently plan to ship net revenues, or report net
revenues of $310 million for this quarter and increase our earnings by a penny a share to  cents a share. There could be some up-side
depending upon our bookings this quarter. But as I mentioned last quarter, we would like to continue to build backlog so that we're not
so dependent on turns.
Gross margins for the company were 70%, in Q4 which is approximately the same as in Q3. But during the fiscal year, our gross margins
have increased, and particularly Dallas's growth margins have increased 6.3%, from 59.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal '02 to 66.2% in
the fourth quarter of fiscal '03. This is a result of -- primarily of improved margins due to moving manufacturing offshore, the increased
productivity at our wafer fab and individual product yield improvement, as well as some contribution from the profitability of the new
products that have been introduced over the last two years.
Operating margins for the corporation also improved throughout the year from 34.4% a year ago to 40.1% this last quarter. Impressively,
Dallas Semiconductor operating margins improved from 26.3% a year ago to 30.7% in the fourth quarter of this year. Operating margins
for Maxim without Dallas improved from 37.6 % to 43.2% for the same period.
Our R&D spending for the fourth quarter was 67.2 million compared to 66.8 million. SG&A spending levels were fundamentally flat on a
dollar basis quarter-over-quarter, and in balance, our below the line spending decreased to 29.9% of net revenues for the fourth quarter,
with Dallas below the line spending at 35.6% of our net revenues and Maxim, without Dallas, at 28% of our net revenues. And we're
continuing to work, and our goal is to achieve a 25% of sales below the line spending. And that's going to be the resultant of primarily
increased revenue growth.
We increased our cash in short-term investment by $107 million during the quarter after we spent  million to repurchase 1.3 million
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Yeah, I can, Michael. Give me one second. I have to look that up . Yeah, we shipped  million -- 70% of what we booked, we turned. Of
what we booked for turns, we shipped. [INAUDIBLE] We booked  million of turns. What was your other question?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Yeah, they were overall $6 million. That's up very slightly from last quarter. The last four quarters, the cancellations have been  million.
Going to Q1 of '03,  million, 7.8 million, down to 6.2 million.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Well, we expect both Dallas and Maxim to grow, you know, over 20% in the next  months. And Dallas could grow faster than that,
maybe as much as 30, but that's our plan, or our projections, based on our knowledge of the economy, our belief in where the economy
is, and where our products are designed into equipment tell us that we should have bookings and growth in that ballpark for both
companies.
 
Rick Schafer CIBC World Market
Is there any reason that the profitability of Dallas wouldn't be able to get up to corporate average over time?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
No, it should get to -- we're running it and making new product decisions with the same criterion that we make at Maxim, so we will
[INAUDIBLE] approach that.
 
Rick Schafer CIBC World Market
Okay, then --
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Well, we're projecting significant growth in notebooks in the next months, and I think one of the factors that you're probably aware of is
that these low-cost notebooks that have been introduced by Dell and HP have been very, very successful, are taking market share away
from the desktops, so we think that's a strategic trend that I think was underanticipated or estimated by maybe you guys, but it's
happening.
 
Rick Schafer CIBC World Market
All right. Well, thanks.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
It very well probably will. I mean, maybe that's just the nature of buying. Maybe everybody buys at the beginning of the quarter, and then
they slow down. I think that's possible. You're right, I mean, that could be the way the buying habits occur.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I don't think so. Hang on a minute. No, I think Dallas bookings -- hang on one second. No, Dallas bookings did not grow last quarter.
They were flat.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Yeah.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
No, I don't think -- I think Dallas -- we're very comfortable with Dallas's growth plan, and we think we understand -- I mean, it's all based
on new products and being in projects. And there's no -- we're dealing with a consolidation, which was significant, much more significant
than Maxim, because they had a large percentage of their business in the telecom market, and they had a huge amount of inventory and
distribution. But all in all, you know, Dallas has been slower to consolidate and get to a baseline where all of the excesses are out of the
system. But other than that -- and, again, they did have a large commitment to the telecom market which they had to digest, or we had
to digest. We think their growth prospects are very similar to Maxim's.
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
But quarter-to-quarter is not very meaningful. I mean, things happen. You have to really look at a longer term than quarter to the
quarter, which I've said forever. But you don't pay much attention to quarter-to-quarter things.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Well, like I said, I mean, you know, we expect to grow from -- we expect to because -- we think consumption is about  million, and
that's up quite a bit from the consumption levels of last quarter. So, yeah, we're -- we're digging out. This economy is growing now, and
Maxim is growing. Dallas is no different than Maxim. I mean, I break them out simply so you guys can continue to see, you know, how the
acquisition is being managed, and how it's doing, but I'm not breaking them out because they're different. There's not -- they basically
are not serving different markets. I think that the company is very much like Maxim.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I think I separated out -- I think I gave you Maxim's bookings and then Dallas's. I said Maxim was up, and Dallas was not. And so we had
no bookings growth in Dallas last quarter.
 
Ross Seymore Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. But either by end market or by product, was there something that offset the strength in the data converter side of the business?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Nothing relevant, really. There was no equipment area that was down.
 
Ross Seymore Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then I believe recently you've eliminated some salary freezes. I was wondering what that is going to mean going forward with
the operating expenses, how we should go about modeling that. It has an effect of approximately 5% increase in our salaries for the year.
I think in below-the-line spending it amounts to maybe a half million dollars a quarter increase. For each of those categories or just split
evenly between the two?
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I'm sorry, what do you mean?
 
Ross Seymore Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
R&D and SG&A.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Let me put it this way: It's insignificant; it's irrelevant. Not going to make any difference.
 
Ross Seymore Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Gotcha. One end market question about the notebook market. There's been a bit more competition there.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Can I just -- I didn't intend to dismiss that question. I mean, it is -- we think that the combination of bonuses and salary that we're
reinstating will have an effect of about $20 million of pre-tax profit for the year on us, which is incorporated in our plan.
 
Ross Seymore Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Fair enough. Then over to the notebook side of things: You seem to be growing quite well in there, and you discuss that the
booking strength, that bodes well for the unit side of things. Is the pricing side more competitive than in the past, less competitive, or just
about the same?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
It's the same. It's not a -- there's not a margin problem in our businesses, so if you get bookings, the margins are usually fine.
 
Ross Seymore Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Then the final question is: What sort of target levels should we think of with inventory? You said you wanted to try to increase it a little bit
this quarter. Should we think about it as an absolute dollar, as a turns level that you're shooting for?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
No, we're trying to build a die bank. We're trying to increase our unfinished product inventory, and it really will come about, or needs to
come about by getting the 8-inch wafer capacity up. And so I would probably maybe -- maybe I shouldn't have even brought that up,
because I think if we do increase inventories, it's going to be small, a million, maybe $2 million, if we can. We'd like to. We'd like to
increase inventories probably $10 million this year, but I don't think -- we're not going to make much progress on it probably this quarter.
 
Ross Seymore Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. Great. Thank you.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
The telecom -- the traditional telecom bookings, or business, is up slightly. There's some growth there. From, you know, basically the
metro and the short haul, and there is a need for equipment there, so I'm sure you're seeing that from other telecom companies. Our fiber
business is growing, you know, at a pretty good rate now. It was destroyed, but it's coming back now, and it's back to about half of the
level it was at its peak. That's both telecom and datacom related. Then our wireless, you know, the cell, you know, the handset business
is doing well, as well as the wireless land business. Those are the areas.
 
 
Christopher Caso SoundView Technology Group
Maybe you can comment on some others during the quarter that talked about some inventory build in handsets during the quarter. Is
that something that you guys saw? Was it significant for you guys?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
No. You mean on the part of our customers?
 
Christopher Caso SoundView Technology Group
That's right.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
No.
 
Christopher Caso SoundView Technology Group
Okay. And just following on, onto your comments on building inventory, where do you stand with wafer starts now? I think you said you
were looking at building wafer starts in the first quarter of the year, increasing those. Are you going to increase them again in an attempt
to build inventory?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
We increased them last quarter, but we didn't end up building much inventory. We'll increase them another 10% this quarter.
 
Christopher Caso SoundView Technology Group
And you increased them 10% last quarter, also?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
No, I don't know the actual number. I don't know if it was 10%. It probably wasn't, but we're trying to grow them, you know, 10% a
quarter.
 
Christopher Caso SoundView Technology Group
Okay. Thanks.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I'm embarrassed because I'm not aware of what you're talking about. I don't have -- I don't have that understanding. I mean, I don't know
about what you're talking about.
 
Joseph Osha Merrill Lynch
I am being told -- obviously, you're very, very competitive, and especially the voltage core for notebooks, and that's been a great business
for you, but lots of companies out there chasing it. Just wondering if it is an environment where pricing is of some concern or not.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Well, I think pricing, I mean, sure. You're not a player if you're not a low-cost producer in that market. We -- my editorial there in my
prepared statements were trying to allude to that. A lot of the people that get into some of these markets, you know, using foundries or
 
-- are typically not low-cost producers. They get their head handed to them. I mean, you've got to be able to be the low-cost producer,
but we are that, and so we're not -- we don't really -- we didn't get into this business to get out. We didn't get in not knowing what the
costs were. But on balance, the notebook market is a good market. I mean, there are a dozen microchips that an analog company
supplies, at least, in the notebook, but most of them are not very -- there isn't a lot of competition.
 
Joseph Osha Merrill Lynch
Okay. That answers my question. Then, just a sort of straight old, simple question. What's utilization, or maybe a better way of putting it,
given your existing fab base, how much revenue do you think you could support at this point without building more?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
We bought the equipment, and almost all of the equipment, probably might have to spend another 50,  million, but we can produce
just under a half billion dollars a quarter with what we've got now at Dallas and at [INAUDIBLE] in Santa Fe and in Beaverton, a quarter.
So I'd say 480,  million, something like that.
 
Joseph Osha Merrill Lynch
Let's hope for that  million this quarter.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I think that you're going to see growth this year from us and other companies.
 
Joseph Osha Merrill Lynch
Okay. Thank you, Jack.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Not really. I think the year-over-year numbers are more telling than any quarter-to-quarter thing. I think Japan still is struggling in the
throes of a recession, if that's what you want to call it. Manufacturing is leaving both the U.S. and Japan going into Taiwan and China. So
a lot of purchasing is occurring, you know, in the Pac Rim. Europe is fundamentally starting to behave normally again, but the size of the
European market was inflated by the telecom boom that went on in every country over there, so now that's stabilized, but it's down a lot
from where it was at its peak. I think the most -- I mean, the thing you walk away with that's relevant is probably only that the Pac Rim is
now reporting a lot of the revenue growth for all the companies, not necessarily because they are that productive, it's that the
manufacturing for phones and notebooks are pretty much occurs in the Pac Rim and in China. So you're seeing those products being
bought for over there and then shipped, exported throughout the world, brought back and shipped.
 
Joseph To Lehman Brothers
Fair enough. One housekeeping question. You mentioned that you wanted to transfer -- or you wanted to have something like 40% of
your wafer starts at 8-inch by the end of next fiscal year. How much of your starts now are at 8-inch? Is anything being produced?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I said 45%, and I think -- let's see here. I can't remember. I think we're producing about  to 30% of ours on 8-inch now.
 
Joseph To Lehman Brothers
Great. Thanks a lot.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Third and fourth fiscal quarter? Yeah, hang on a minute. Dallas revenue in the third quarter was  million. In the fourth quarter it was 
million.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Well, Dallas is just running very well. Their manufacturing yields are up. We've got all the off-shore -- onshore stuff, off-shore. The
individual product yields are good. Their new products are -- like I said all along, they've got a lot of new products. We've put a lot into
the market, and they're all very proprietary. They don't suffer much competition at all. So we've done -- I mean that's contributing a high
margin. So the gross margins, you know, went up 6% year-over-year, and that's huge, you know. So that's what's happening. We're not --
the below-the-line spending is still out of whack. It's 35% of sales below the line. So we're working to get that number down. We want
that number to be down in the 26, 27% area, which it will get to.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I was talking about gross margin. I better check. The Dallas gross margin, yeah, they went -- that was a year-over-year number. I hope I
gave you year-over-year. I meant that it was year-over-year. The quarter-to-quarter was only 1%, or half a percent.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
You said gross margin, right? No, I'm sorry. Wait a minute. Hang on a minute. Carl is pointing something out to me. What am I looking at
here? Gross margin? Hang on a minute. I've got two conflicting reports here. The Dallas gross margin, yeah, they went -- they were
65.7% in Q3 and 6.4% in Q4. The year-over-year improvement is what we talked about when I talked about earlier, right? I'll go back.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Louis, did you get --
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Operating margins. I was talking gross margins.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Okay. The operating margins, you know, did go from 24.4 to 30.7. I thought you said gross margin. No. And that came about, you know,
primarily because we've been able to reduce below the line spending.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
That assumes that we'll be -- this conversion to 8-inch will have occurred with the equipment we've got in place.
 
Brian Wu Bear, Stearns & Company
I think you said you were going to spend another  to  million. Is that all for 8-inch equipment?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Yeah, it would be.
 
Brian Wu Bear, Stearns & Company
Would the total cap ex, I guess -- the last couple of years you've been spending between  and  million. Would it be about the same,
or would you expect that to go up?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I think, you know, it's a moving target, but it's in the  million area --  to  million is where it would be for the year.
 
Brian Wu Bear, Stearns & Company
Okay. Thank you very much.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
When bookings increase.
 
Tore Svanberg U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffrey, Inc.
Do you think we could see that as early as this calendar year?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Oh, I think we expect bookings to increase, you know, this next quarter. I think turns will flatten out at about  million. That's my
opinion. I mean, I'm guessing. My feeling is that you won't -- turns won't continue to grow but bookings will.
 
Tore Svanberg U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffrey, Inc.
Okay. Very well. And also looking at the high-speed microcontrollers coming out of the Dallas division, are these products targeted at
new applications, or are we also looking at some potential replacement technology here?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
They're mostly targeted at new applications. They're targeted -- they're very application-specific. They're doing things that weren't being
done before by a microcontroller or a microcontroller-based, smart microchip. There's an evolution going on right now in equipment
where a lot of functions now can be done intelligently, and that were not being done intelligently in the last generation of equipment.
And it's coming about because we can now integrate very, very high-performance analog functions on the same chip with somewhat
[INAUDIBLE] in microcontrollers but effective ones like  types and other risk-type controllers. So it's a new -- it's a -- there is some
cannibalization, but it's not of our product, it's other discrete approaches to these things.
 
 
Tore Svanberg U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffrey, Inc.
Understood. Finally, coming back to the notebook market, it's -- obviously, becoming more of wireless technology as well. You
mentioned potential market share gains in the notebook market. Would that primarily be on the power management side or on the
wireless side?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Well, we don't count the wireless -- we are now -- yeah, the notebooks are -- we are selling wireless circuits for notebook applications,
there's no doubt, but we don't count that as notebook business. We only look at -- when we talk about battery management, power
management, we don't have a category called notebooks, in general. We have portable -- products for portable equipment, and those
include everything -- and then we have communications products. So when I talk about growth in our notebook business, I'm really
talking about everything but the radio.
 
Tore Svanberg U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffrey, Inc.
Great. Thank you for that clarification.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Yeah.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Well, you know, I think your analysis is right. First of all, it's not a majority of our business. Okay? It's -- we don't have any one thing that's
that big a share of our market of our business. But it's important to us, but it's in the -- the wireless business is 15% of our business, or
16%, something like that. We have growth in the wireless land area, we have growth in the terrestrial radio area, we have growth in the
CDMA -- in the advanced CDMA phone areas. We have -- we provide a high level of integration, probably the highest level of integration
in the world as far as no other company is providing radios with as much integration as Maxim has. We integrate passive compos; we
integrate the power amplifier. So we are providing a level of product that people desire in terms of these next-generation phones. We
have no business in the GSM area or these other areas. So we're just -- we're a CDM A -- fundamentally a CDMA company in the cell
phone area.
 
Clark Fuse Fulcrum Global Partners
And I take it your exposure to Korea is less?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Well, I don't what that means. You mean exposure? You mean the North Koreans?
 
Clark Fuse Fulcrum Global Partners
No. Good. Touche. No, I meant Samsung, LG.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I don't consider them an enemy, no, they're customers of ours.
 
Clark Fuse Fulcrum Global Partners
Right, but are they less a portion of your business than other CDMA?
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
They're not less. They're major CDMA companies. So is -- there's a set of five or six of them. They're all customers.
 
Clark Fuse Fulcrum Global Partners
Okay. How about the ATE business? There's been some reports that the test equipment guys are starting to show some signs of life.
What do you see there?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Would you have them call me?
 
Clark Fuse Fulcrum Global Partners
So you're suggesting that that's still kind of a dead market as it's been for you for awhile?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
It's not -- it's not getting deader, but it isn't -- it hasn't started to improve yet. It's not -- no, it's not one of the markets that I would say is
improved last quarter.
 
Clark Fuse Fulcrum Global Partners
Great. And you said your end market expectations for the first quarter was  million. Do you have a number for overall fiscal '04?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Yeah, I can share with you what our business units are planning on, and what they believe, and they believe that they are going to --
there's a demand for about $1.5 billion of our product this year, in the next  months.
 
Clark Fuse Fulcrum Global Partners
Great. And one other housekeeping thing. What kind of depreciation are you expecting for next year?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
About  million a quarter. Nothing changed. That's the depreciation expense.
 
Clark Fuse Fulcrum Global Partners
And tax rate is still 33%?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Yeah.
 
Clark Fuse Fulcrum Global Partners
Super. That's it for me.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Thank you.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Our -- you know, we have -- gosh. We introduce so many products a quarter in a year, but I'm going to have to generalize a bit. But on
balance, the products we are introducing are of higher complexity than other companies. That, I'm sure is correct. And I think our -- you
know, our ASP's are higher for each generation of product that we come out with simply because there's more integration. Having said
that, there are areas that, you know -- prices are, on a per function basis, the cost of microchips, or the cost of function is going down,
which is what's causing this amazing, this tremendous unit growth and the pervasiveness of what we do. But we're doing more of it now.
And so, therefore, we're collecting more revenue, but the price per function on a component basis, on an amplifier basis or [comparator]
basis or maybe even a data converter basis is down, but overall, on a per chip basis, it's not down.

All right. Just sort of a follow-up to that. Do you foresee any change in your company's strategy regarding 802.11 type of circuits that
we've seen by recently by others in the analog space due to heavy price pressure and standardization in that market? Do you see --
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Were you on the last conference call?
 
Doug Friedman UBS Investment Bank
No, I was not.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Okay. Well, I think in the last two or three conference calls, at least, and for the last year I've said 802.11 is a valuable function and it's a
valuable technology. It's providing -- it's benefiting mankind. But as far as a -- an important place to be, you know, a strategic place to be
as a supplier of those, how strategic it is, it's not very. Anytime you're supplying a product to a standard or to a regulation, I mean, it's a
commodity, or will soon be a commodity, and so, you know, you're not going to -- there's going to be a lot of people making those
circuits. The guys that will make some money on it will be the low-cost producers. We're one of those, but, you know, it's not -- there's not
a lot of after -- this next generation, there's not going to be a lot of value-added making -- designing new circuits. And so, you know,
you're going to probably not design another one.
 
Doug Friedman UBS Investment Bank
All right. Thank you.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I think I've done that to the extent that I can on a conference call like this. I really would -- I don't want to really repeat myself.
 
Krishna Shankar JMP Securities, LLC
What about the industrial market and your orders from the distribution channel? Can you characterize sequential trends in those two
areas?
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Yeah, the industrial or general purpose -- not general purpose, but the mixed-signal analog product that tend to go into a broad variety
of applications, we've had growth in the last two quarters in those areas. We have three business units in Dallas that serve those markets,
those broad markets, and we have one large business unit at Maxim, and it's about 40% of our business when you combine the two. They
are growing.
 
Krishna Shankar JMP Securities, LLC
Okay. Thank you.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
No, I don't draw that conclusion. My conclusion is that, unfortunately, they have -- in many cases they've developed a function, maybe
not unique to them, but a function that's useful, and what -- but they find themselves not able to supply it because of their cost
limitations. And it's the customer is, you know, really requiring a different price, and there's other guys making it. So they find themselves
not in a position to -- I don't see them as being a price leader. I see them actually getting run out of the market. I don't find that argument
-- I mean, that scenario -- I mean, I would put broadcom in that position. I mean, everybody seems to be comfortable that they make
40% gross margins, but if Maxim made 40% gross margins you wouldn't be comfortable with that, and I don't think you're really that
viable if you're a  or 40% gross margin microchip company, because you're not going to give the customer, you know, the lowest cost
possible. So they don't really lead -- these fabless companies do not lead prices down. They basically drop out of the markets, and I think
you find, you know, a lot of them for sale right now, and they just -- you can acquire them if you want to acquire the products, but you are
pretty much saddled with having to use their foundry processes, too. But the answer to your question, I don't see them as a price leader
or as a driving -- or hurting the market
 
Andrew Root Goldman Sachs
Broadcom aside, are there any companies that you find attractive that are looking to sell themselves?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
You know, the ones that are for sale -- there's several radio companies that are for sale, and for that reason, they can't compete. The
problem is, if you -- we have most of the radio functions, but somebody who didn't, might buy them. But now, you're fundamentally --
you've got to somehow -- if you don't have your own manufacturing, you're no sense in buying them, and if you do have your own
manufacturing, you now have to convert their circuits into your own manufacturing, which is another redesign. So it's pretty cumbersome
to acquire these things. I think in some cases there may be, you know, some design automation or software value to some IP that could
be of use, but I'm not -- no, I'm not sitting here spending a lot of time evaluating these things right now.
 
Andrew Root Goldman Sachs
Then the last quick question on the dividend, as a percent of your earnings this quarter, it's in the mid-30's. Is that absent some other use
of cash -- compelling use of cash? Is that the kind of pay-out you guys are settling on, or is that still evolving?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Would you start that over? I didn't follow you.
 
 
Andrew Root Goldman Sachs
Sure. Your dividend this quarter at  cents -- I'm just dividing the  cents into your earnings and looking at a dividend pay-out ratio, I
think you're kind of answering the question. That's not necessarily a target ratio. It's just where you happen to be today.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I never even -- right. I had not even done that ratio, so I'm ignorant of that ratio. No, we do it -- I tried to explain, our Board, you know, is
very conservative, and they, you know, and they're also shareholders, and they -- we feel we want to be as attractive a company as we can
to our shareholders, and we want to demonstrate that we are a profitable cash generating company and that we can distribute a
dividend that's interesting without it having any effect on our operating ability, and that's what we're doing here. I mean, that number is,
you know, gee, we generate $400 million of cash a year, and, you know, we're -- we clearly can -- we've got 1.2 billion in the bank. We
clearly can distribute $100 million without it having any effect. That's what it's all about.
 
Andrew Root Goldman Sachs
That makes sense. Thanks.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Jeff, I don't have the right break, the exact break-out, but I will tell you right now you will never see the number. It will not -- it won't
make any difference. I mean, as far as an increase in expense. I know that the R&D increased about a half million a quarter, so it's about
 million is the R&D number of the 20, and I guess the rest of it is pretty much above the line.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Excuse me?
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Smaller than the R&D number.
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
Well, I mean, I will share with you, you know, the think -- which I tend to not do this, but first of all, I think we're talking, you know,
probably, total below-the-line increase in salaries due to those two issues is going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of, you know,
$10 million of the 20. Okay? 2.5 million.
 
 
John Gifford Maxim Integrated Products - Chairman, President, CEO
I'm sorry, four times -- yeah, two and a half -- that's not right. A half a million, 700,000 -- that's wrong. About  to  million of it is going
to be below the line. The other  million,  million, is going to be above the line. Okay? So that doesn't have a lot to do with increasing
our below-the-line spending as a percent. What I -- what we're going to do, as far as getting -- our goal is to get to 25% below-the-line
spending. Obviously, you know, I've got to use good judgment as to how to do that. I'm not going to not grow our engineering
organizations. In fact, you know, in the last two quarters, we're adding, you know,  people in engineering. But you have to realize that
Dallas is operating at -- they have got an abundance of engineers. They have 35% below-the-line spending, and they really do -- we do
have a huge headcount in Dallas below the line given their revenue. So we don't have to add anybody in Dallas. So our additions will
occur in Maxim, and we will grow, you know, as fast as we can with regard to, you know, our technical people, as fast as we can find them
at Maxim. We don't have any plan to not hire. We have no plan to control our -- to stifle our growth by refusing to spend below the line.
I'm just saying that we aren't going to spend at Dallas, and we are going to spend at Maxim, and Dallas is going to have revenue growth,
as is Maxim. And the result of that will get us -- I believe in the next  months, you know, close to 25%.
