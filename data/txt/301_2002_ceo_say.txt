Volume and profitability in the quarter were certainly an improvement over where we've been. The volume side of the equation is coming
along very well. In fact, we had announced in the third quarter that we had picked up significant new business for that facility. And the
objective is to continue to grow that, and I think we're in a position to do it. So I'm less concerned about volume. The production cost side
of it, we're still not totally there. We've got -- still have some issues related to deposit problems, trying to make sure that we're mining in
the most cost effective way. But the cost structure is much improved. And we're on a course to get, you know, get to where we set out to
be. So we're still not there but much improved over where we've been.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
Okay. Janice will pull up, you got the quarterly number? $43m in the quarter. And that was more than we had anticipated. What's
happening is that unlike the last couple of years, where all the projects we're doing lag and drag, because of lack of personnel available
or a company's busy, nobody's busy out there right now so we had the opportunity to move projects much quicker, got a lot of attention,
and we completed some projects at a faster clip than we expected, therefore, the higher capital expenditure level than we anticipated. As
we go into 2003, it's a year where we're looking at expenditure in the DD&A level, somewhere in the $135m to $140m range as we're
looking at in our capital plan. And depending what conditions are as we go forward, we're going to play it pretty cautiously. That could be
pulled in, you know, if the environment were to get a little worse than we think. We're not going to start off the year by expending all the
capital plan.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
Sure.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
Hi, Jack.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
I think the federal part of it is going to be a much prettier picture than the stateside of it. There are some states that are in deep, deep
trouble. Actually I read a state by state synopsis yesterday, and probably the two that stuck out the most are Virginia, which according to
the numbers I saw, you know, they're looking at a $6b deficit. They're the only state that did not take advantage of federal allocation
under T-21 in this recent year, this past fiscal year. They left some money on the table. And they actually stopped construction projects
underway, which is rare. So they have a deep problem based on the magnitude of the deficit in California, certainly appears that that
problem is pretty severe. Those are the two that kind of pop out. But virtually every state's dealing with it. You know, the states that we
are in, I would expect to see a slight negative, Jack. But the positive for us is that the work in the areas, the big areas that we're in, in key
states, looks pretty good.
So you know, a lot of times it comes back to specific metro location, where you have your plants, and you know, overall I think we're
positioned pretty well for the coming year. On -- does that answer that question?
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
Okay. On composites, you know kind of an interesting opportunity. We've talked about it a little bit in the past but two things have
happened that trigger more disclosure and you know, we'll put it on your screen and we'll be talking about it more as we go forward.
First of all, we did take down the factory location in the fourth quarter and we put out a public release on that so we physically made that
move. Secondly, we did acquire the additional proprietary technology in the fourth quarter, and frankly, that's something we've been
waiting on because panel technology to go with our bridge deck support technology is a very important component of what we're
working with.
The capital intensity of composites is very low. And we structured it that way particularly in the early years. As you might imagine in
looking for a factory site, your choices are many, and your pursuers are few. We actually had  buildings to look at on the first cut in
western North Carolina and by the time we got through, we wound up with a lease arrangement on that building which is extremely
attractive with an option to buy. So it will be several years out before we actually make the capital component of the investment. We will
be setting-up equipment in the facility for assembly lines. When you look at that, in working capital in the first couple of years, say, after
2004, it's tough to see us having, you know, more than $10m or so invested in that business at that point. The growth in investment as
we go forward is, you know, as we see it at this point is going to be, you know, purely incremental related to particular product lines and
 
supporting the working capital necessary to finance the business. This is not a capital intensive business which is one of the very
appealing parts of it. We're going to be doing limited. manufacturing which means we don't have big, complex production lines with high
investment. It's predominantly assembly, with the rope manufacturing done by other companies that we have relationships with. So we'll
be buying shapes, components, on most of the structural part of it. And then we'll be manufacturing the panel side of it at our Sparta
location. So hopefully that gives you an idea.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
Sure.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
I'll give you the volume. Virginia/Maryland area down about 6%. North Carolina down 17%. And I can assure you that wasn't driven by the
soft economy, a small portion. That was weather. Southeast, the rest of the Southeast down 15.5%, same issue. In this part of the
country, we just skipped fall, went straight from summer to winter. In the southwest which we got off to a very good start in the
southwest the first half of the year, they got hammered, same issue in the fourth quarter. Volume's down 12%. Mid-America area,
Indiana, Ohio, down 6%. Midwest with Iowa being the key state, surrounding states, down 8%, and central, the water born area which is
coastal southeast coast, Gulf Coast predominantly and the river markets, up 4%.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
Sure. The two strong areas in Texas have been, and we think will continue to be, the south Texas NAFTA corridor down in the Corpus
Christi, Brownsville, Laredo area. We had a very good year this past year and we expect we're going to see further improvement and
positive demand in that area, driven truly by NAFTA. San Antonio market looks positive and we're on course, we started out with a very,
very good year there and again we got hammered by the weather conditions which I hate to talk about but it's just a fact. And as we look
at '03 in San Antonio, we think we're going to have a good year there. Houston market is a little more problematic. We think it's going to
be an okay year there, okay meaning that it's going to be somewhat similar to '02, could be up a little, could be down a little.
And then the big question mark is Dallas, Fort Worth and our Oklahoma locations which are smaller areas. Dallas, Fort Worth, there is
some significant transportation work in Dallas, Fort Worth in '03. That will be the primary plus in the market. The commercial market will
probably drop a little bit more. That's a very, very soft commercial market. So all in all, I would expect that that area probably hits the
trough this year. And hopefully, begins to rebuild with transportation offsetting the building construction side. Does that help?
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
Sure. I'll ask Janice to do that.
 
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
Sure.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
Hi.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
I'll give you a quick answer and Janice can give you the explanation. You can get a lesson in depletion allowance which is one of the most
important things in our industry and she'll tell you about the difference between tax deductible and non-tax deductible goodwill.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
And another way to look at the whole equation is that if we'd had anything like reasonable shipping conditions of the Southeast and
Southwest we would have been well above what we're talking about now. You know, up at the top of the range, maybe even beyond the
top of the range.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
Okay, let me give it to you in a couple of pieces. You know, first of all, we got hit -- the timing of divestitures in '02 hurt our earnings,
because we sold the Columbus quarries after accumulating the winter losses but before accumulating the earnings during the year. We
sold them about the worst time so that goes away. We don't have the Columbus losses we ate. We don't have the startup costs
associated with the Bahamas. In addition to that, we have closed  facilities during the year and you kind of zero all that out and
baseline, there's about $10m there very quickly.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
Well, I can give it to you in -- let me think about it. You run three small plants, first of all your headcount, personnel cost is exorbitant.
The personnel cost is roughly double what we would have in an efficient plant. So you're going to take that down to a very efficient
personnel cost so that's a starting point. You're also expending the energy cost, supply cost, energy in feeding and hauling from three
plants. You're expending the energy costs associated with operating three plants. If the plant itself with power consumption, the supply
cost in terms of supply and repair costs associated with three plants, two of which are very old plants, it was extremely high.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
So you take those out, and what we put in is a very well-designed, highly efficient modular plant that has more capacity than the three
plants combined. That's why you get in front of it. So you have a significant variable cost reduction. When I say significant, I mean very
significant. And then, on the fixed cost side, what you're going to do is you're going to run more tons through that than you were running
through the three plants. We expect the tonnage is going to be up 20%, 25% versus what we're running the three plants. So that's where
it comes from.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
I don't know. Maybe you could tell us. It's a confounding equation. I can tell you that in '02, we were very positive obviously in the first
half of the year as diesel went down. And the second half of the year we were negative and in the fourth quarter we had roughly in terms
of total energy cost, natural gas, adjustments on the water for fuel escalators, you know, diesel and such, we were about $2.5m negative.
As we go into the first half of '03, we're going to have a negative compare, because diesel is up in the $.90 range now. Last year in the
first quarter it was in the $.60s. So we'll have a negative compare there. The offset to that is we're also -- we're dropping out some places
that we are consuming a disproportionate amount of diesel. We have renewed a lot of mobile equipment where the consumption is less
and that's a positive. But we do expecting to be negative in the first two quarters. From the middle of the year on to the back two quarters
we'll compare against higher diesel prices, and you tell me what's happening in Iraq and the Middle East, certainly you can make a
positive case that if things go well, we're not sitting here coping with $33, $34 a barrel oil prices. It is not just the Middle East right now.
Venezuela is a real problem based on its leading supply position to the U.S. but not just in terms of the diesel gasoline side of the
equation. Venezuela is the measured supplier of liquid asphalt to the U.S. through CITGO. And particularly to the eastern sector of the
country. And I just listen to one of the major energy company CEOs comment on that. We were on the platform of a convention together.
And he said  to  days, and it's a real problem on the supply side. So hopefully, Venezuela is going to get solved, and you know, Iraq
gets solved quickly but you know, who knows.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
Sure.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
The objective is to get that paid down and have a little positive cash so we reduce net debt below our $700m term debt number and
bring the debt to cap down into toward mid 30s.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
That's the objective.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
No.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
Uh-huh.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
I'll give you qualitative comments on that and that's about the best I can do at this point. We had a miserable first quarter last year. And
that was powered, we had Bahamas startup losses which were significant. We had Meridian repair cost, it was the first winter shut-down
period we had with Meridian. And we will not have those kinds of things coming at us this year. So if we have something called normal,
and I'm beginning to wonder if I even know what it is in terms of seasonal patterns, certainly an expectation that we will have a positive
first quarter compared to last year. When you get to the second quarter, we had a report second quarter. We just knocked the socks off.
 
We had good weather, seasonal pattern was very nice, volume was relatively good, costs, we ran our business the way we'd like to run it.
We also in the second quarter had significant gain on sale from the divestitures, that will not be repeating. And I would say to you that it
will be tough to match up to the operating performance that we had last year, given the environment we're in. You know, volume is going
to be tough to come by. So that would be those two quarters. One probably positive, the other probably negative.
You get to the back half of the year, and if we have passage of the federal transportation bill at 31.8 and we get that done pretty quickly,
it's likely going to free up some money, you're going to have more workout there, give the states’ confidence that they've got their federal
component, and I see that as probably getting us just a little bit more stimulus in the back half. And if you look at the relative
comparisons, you have third quarter was not a really bad quarter. It was okay. Hopefully, we have -- we match up or maybe have a little
positive. Fourth quarter was a miserable quarter, back to, you know, the weather pattern coupled with bad economy. I hope we have
positive compare there so that's qualitative in terms of float.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
Sure.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
The way we think about it is from our standpoint, we certainly think our stock is cheap. I mean, I'll say that very pointedly. I can also tell
you that the management group believes that because we've committed close to $1m for share purchase within the officer group. And
you'll see some Form 4s showing up including a pretty significant portion for me. With respect to the company itself, you know, we have
said to the people who have loaned us money that we're going to make sure that we are a worthy company to make loans to. Because in
the future, we may want to borrow some more money, if the appropriate opportunity comes up. So we're going to stick to the knitting on
that. We're going to pay the debt down to get back in the debt cap ratio and other ratios that credit agencies look at and make sure we
are where we ought to be, need to be. And then at that point we're in a position to consider and certainly will consider what we do with
that free cash flow to the benefit of our shareholders.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
You're talking about this month and if you haven't you'll see some Form 4s.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
We don't see a lot that is attractive. Probably the lowest level of things we have an interest in, we've seen in the last six, seven years, we
do have some active deals that we're working on. We always do. We also have some active divestitures that we're working on. And I've
said before we've got a few more things that we want to divest of. Example, we have a couple of plants up in Columbus that we did not
sell to Old Castle. We've indicated publicly that we're going to divest those so you should expect that. We've got a couple of other pieces
 
that we'll probably deal with that way. Not big dollars, you know, not nearly as much as we did in '02. And at that point you know, we'll
be pretty much baseline. So we'll continue to look at acquisitions, we'll continue to sort out things that we don't want to go forward with
for the long term. And I would expect to have all that divestiture done that we've got on the screen right now, by the end of '02. That's the
target, that's what we want to accomplish.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
'03, yeah.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
Yeah, reauthorization is -- the current T-21 expires September 30, 2003. And then we will have a follow-on. History says that Congress
will not pass that prior to September 30. It typically goes over into the first quarter of the following year. So I would expect, you know, Q1
‘04, we've got a new bill. In the meantime, we still don't have a budget for the year that began October 1, '02. And that is what I was
commented in the short term the $31.8b.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
I really don't think that there's going to be any clarity, Steve. There are so many different views of it, what is likely to happen is that the
administration is going to toss a number out there. They'll submit their budget here in February. And I would expect that they will toss a
very low number out for transportation, just like they did for '03. Remember, they tossed out a $23b number as opposed to $27.7b that
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
You're going to need revenue enhancement of different types. Lot of ideas as to how to do that, including some bonding. I don't know
where that will go but certainly it's up on the screen.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
It would be a rare year where it wasn't, either by low or high water. That's the nature of the barge business. We see it both ways.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
One of the things you have to do, if you're going to be in the barging business, is that you've got to have a very good distribution network
with space to hold inventory. Because as you're alluding to the ability to move barges can be problematic based on weather. So one of
our strengths is that we do in fact have a well established, well located distribution yard network. So we'll keep some inventory on those
yards. It would be rare that we would miss any sales. It would also be rare that we didn't have some barges stacked up at some point of
year because of low water or high water.
 
Stephen P. Zelnack Jr. Martin Marietta Materials - Chairman and President and CEO
At this point, I'd like to thank you for joining in obviously a very difficult scenario to forecast. We've tried to give you as much information
as we possibly can and hopefully it's been helpful to you, and we'll talk to you again at the end of the first quarter. Thank you.
