Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
With that said, I’d like to introduce Align Technology’s President and CEO, Tom Prescott. Tom?
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
Thank you, Barbara and welcome to everybody on the call today and on the web.
We’re very pleased with the solid progress made in Q1. This visible improvement in operating results, coupled with our internal focus on key strategic programs, gives us confidence that we are on the right track to build a company that can sustain growth over the long-term. That said, while we are pleased with this progress, we are far from satisfied; there’s still a lot of work to do.
We reported our best quarter ever, with $51.2 million in revenue, a sequential increase of over 17% from last quarter. We reported EPS of
$0.03. In both cases, we exceeded our own guidance and the Street consensus. Underlying this performance improvement is the belief that many of the issues we encountered in the second half of  have been, or are being, addressed.
Let me start with a few key growth metrics.
On the revenue line, both the orthodontist and GP dentist channel revenues and cases continued to increase. We saw a sequential increase among orthodontists of 18.2% to $23.3 million. GP revenues sequentially increased 22.2% to $20.7 million. Overall, 45% of total revenues came from U.S. orthodontists.
Additionally, the individual I brought into lead worldwide sales, Bob Mitchell, resigned to be CEO of a startup company in the interventional cardiology field, his first love.
I guess at some level, all this is a compliment. You want this kind of [tint] on your organization that everybody else wants. That said, this
was fairly disruptive and we are still working through filling those roles, along with the challenge of expanding the field team as we originally planned.
So just to give you some numbers around this, at the end of December,  we had  ortho reps and  GP reps. In all those numbers, I refer only to sales reps that carried quotas. At the end of March 2005, our orth sales rep headcount was down to 22. This includes the  that joined OrthoClear and a few others that departed for other reasons, as well as netting out the hiring of  ortho reps in the quarter and the promotion of a few of the reps.
We believe we are squarely on track to rebuild the ortho team. In a moment I’ll let you know about how we’re going about reestablishing that coverage.
On the GP side, we ended March with  GP reps, well on track to add  more GP reps in the first half of 2005. We currently have a
full-scale program underway to recruit, train, and deploy more sales reps this year. We expect to have just over  total sales reps in the field by the end of the year. We have a very clear recruiting profile. We have a high impact process to onboard these new reps, getting them trained, connecting them with mentors in the sales team, and getting them deployed out in front of customers.
There are a number of new sales reps and a few sales managers in this development pipeline that will be deployed in the next month or so. We are seeing outstanding talent. I know this because I get to meet with each of the new training classes and I continue to be impressed at the caliber of people who join our team.
In the interim, we have had ortho reps covering multiple territories, GP reps and sales managers helping out, and customer support trying to fill gaps. These temporary measures have been put in place due to a tremendous effort by the Align team and some patience on the part of our customers. Many customers want and need better coverage and we expect to give it to them.
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
That’s correct.
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
No, Tao, the way I would think about this is continuous improvement. As we continue to ask doctors, as they go through the process of initiating working with Invisalign, one of the things that they say is that they want to get through that cycle of four to five to six cases as quickly as they can. With as complete a possible support infrastructure as they can, shortly after certification. This is based on their feedback.
And so, actually, with bringing general orthodontics in now what we call ICS, we actually have an ability to kind of wrap around them and help facilitate that more quickly. Imagine that they had a best friend who was an orthodontist who could coach them through some simple cases. That’s what we’re effectively doing. We are not reaching back and applying that same standard to other doctors, but we are reaching out to those doctors that may not have had such an easy start.
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
I’ll let Roger speak to any of the OrthoClear issues.
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
Raj.
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
I think--yes. Raj, I think what Eldon said earlier was if and when we do see the product and it has implications for what’s going on in our revenue ramp. We’re going to come back and comment on that. But at this point in time, we’re trying to build the business consistent with our game plan.
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
Well, again, there’s a couple things that went on last quarter that made it look worse than it probably was.
One of those was we did drop -- and I want to be careful with my numbers. Barbara can help. We did drop, I think, several hundred orthodontists into the pool of new orthos and it’s kind of the number of doctors that are doing a pretty static number and even  doctors more can change it slightly on a small base. The second thing that was going on, it was a down quarter for them in terms of leads, in terms of their productivity and so those things all stack up.
I think what I’d say this quarter is not racy but headed the right direction and certainly positive, from our perspective, since were scratching and clawing to cover all these important customers and we literally had half the territories not formally covered. So, I think our opportunity is to provide them with great coverage, help them grow their business, launch the new marketing programs, create some excitement and continue to see that grow. But we have a lot of work to do.
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
Thanks, Ryan.
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
Let me start with GP, first of all. We’ve said for really the last year, year and a half, that at some point in time, as we continue to scale this team, as we continue to train lots of GP doctors, it would likely make sense to find the right partners.
Now who the right partners and how you decide to do the work in the channel, those are all things that those are very significant choices. So what I would say is we’re interested in thinking about that. We are not close to doing anything formally and I think just it’s an opportunity that we’re going to continue to evaluate.
On the Japanese side, again I left that out of my prepared comments a little bit because we had so much other information to talk about and it’s not a near-term revenue opportunity. We actually just had the first ever symposium, Invisalign symposium in Japan, on Saturday and Sunday. On Sunday, actually, last week - it was just a couple days ago, actually - I was there and we had probably  of the most influential Japanese orthodontists. Very, very interest, spending all day hearing presentations by Japanese and American experienced orthodontists.
So, I think the way I’d think about this is our approach to Japan all along has been to take a very thoughtful, deliberate approach. And if you look back to some of the missteps that Align took as it entered the U.S. market, we did not gain the support of U.S. orthodontists, the specialists that were kind of gatekeepers at the time of new technology. And as a result, we’ve had to work uphill over some number of years to get back in their good grace.
We’re trying to do just the opposite in Japan and we do have a small core team on the ground there, four or five people that have been working very hard with advisors and I’ve had multiple meetings over there. We’ve had very experienced doctors from Europe and the U.S. teaching some Japanese doctors. They’ve got cases they’ve started, they’re developing their own clinical results and at the same time, with building a small core team, Align Japan, we’ve been working very hard to put together, to assess, who would be an ideal joint venture partner and when would you want to commence that.
We continue to do that. Our focus here is moving the business forward in a very logical way. We probably wouldn’t move to any
large-scale commercialization push without a joint venture partner at least lined up. But we are going to move forward, likely late this year and start initial certifications.
So, again, the idea will be to start with a core group of important influential Japanese doctors, helping them gain experience and really,
this is really a 3- to 5-year opportunity. This is not something that’s going to provide meaningful impact on the top line near-term. In fact, it’s going to cost us a little money. But I think Japan could wind up being an incredibly important market for us and very valuable for this enterprise for the long-term.
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
Okay, so it sounds like two questions there, really. The first issues is yes, we are driving forward with the plans to connect the business. We’re going to have more to talk about, in the coming months about that. We don’t want to kind of get ahead of ourselves. But that’s why we talked about the capital budget in the timeframe.
We are pushing ahead as aggressively as we can to improve quality, reduce costs, and decrease variability in the entire process and really, automation goes to the heart of that. So it is a very, very important strategic initiative and we’re making great progress.
The second question I want to come back again. It was the question about international?
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
I’ll let Eldon reiterate what he said earlier.
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
So that’s a mouthful. Let me maybe start with the first one and perhaps Roger and I together can carefully respond to what our original presence was in Pakistan. When we came out in January or in early February to discuss what we thought the implications of the litigation were, we were not at a point where we were comfortable to talk about impact on the business.
We were suspecting there could be significant disruption. We didn’t know and we told everybody that as soon as we got visibility we may have to pull it down, in terms of our expectations. In fact, what our whole organization did was kind of jump into hyperdrive and as I said earlier, we have sales managers that started calling on key accounts and GP reps that helped out in a geographic area. And senior management that got on the road to go see customers - and you wouldn’t expect that normally to help, would you - and customer support that had relationships with the local office people on a day-to-day basis. And we really asked our customers for help in getting through the challenge.
Some of them were also disappointed that their reps left and so what I’d say is I’m pleased. I don’t want to talk in more detail, at a territory by territory level, kind of what happened. But I’m pleased that on the aggregate the departed, the areas where we had open territories kind of performed at very close to the same level than before these people left. And I’d say that’s both patience on behalf of our customers and God bless them, and a lot of extra work on behalf of our team.
I wouldn’t want to live on that, so before the finance people say hey, we can have fewer salespeople, the reality is we want to be fully staffed. And in fact, I think that it’s probably highly likely that this Company has never been completely deployed the way we can and I’m really looking forward to having our deployment model catch up with our opportunity and seeing what we can really do. But we still got a few holes to fill.
So, again, maybe I think there’s some luck involved. I think our customers were really gracious with us, but we’ve got some making up to do.
The second issue that Roger and I can maybe team up on -- we had a great group of people in Pakistan. There were several different things they did. The principle thing that was set up in Pakistan was what we called “treat” and that is what we now do in Costa Rica. We used to do principally treat in Pakistan. We also had a satellite operation in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates near Dubai that was there kind of as a safety valve if something bad happened in Pakistan, kind of in the post-9/11 world and we had interruption to our business, we could quickly move employees over to the UAE. Temporarily house them and then still, hopefully, with some but not lasting disruption, be able to get cases set up and treat operations done.
We also, at one point in time, under the former leadership, they were looking at moving consumer call center and the customer service over there. That didn’t work as well and we already had changed that. So we never did aligner fabrication over there. We never did the front end of the process, order entry. We never did kind of the road test stuff. So we did one element of manufacturing and that was treat.
I certainly don’t want to comment--I don’t want to comment on what OrthoClear is or is not doing. But I think the simple fact is, we’ve got--the way we look at it, they’ve got a lot. They’ve got an uphill battle. They’ve got a new company, a new process. We’ll let the court process work and that’s not something that concerns me day-to-day. That’s something for our lawyers.
Our organization is proud of what we’ve done and we’re going to try and even improve customer service and make the product even better and extend our lead and grow the business and be a very, very tough competitor in the marketplace.
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
Thanks very much.
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
Hi Taylor.
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
Well, I’m going to start with the easy part of that question, which is the last part, which is we’re not ready to talk about that. It’s in pilot mode. I’d like to get more market experience with it before I go further.
But we have described for some period of time that what we think of an Invisalign is it’s the extended product plus the aligner, actually the aligners that move teeth. We’re going to, over time, create more breadth to that product set of offerings, both the way we wrap clinical support and the extended product services around aligners and the aligners themselves, the work we’re doing for the orthodontist or dentist.
So it’s been our intention for some time to come out with let’s call it a simple case offering that’s more cost-effective and I think over time we’d like to make that even more cost-effective than our current offering. We’d like to get after those very simple cases where they might need 5, 6,7,8 aligners, a few months of work, but would not be willing to pay kind of what the market bears today, which is around
$3000-4000, even for a simple case.
So, imagine -- and this is based on a lot of consumer work and interviews with doctors around where pricing issues are. And imagine that you had a straightforward, simple, easy to use offering that people could come in and for a reasonable price get whiter, straighter teeth and they get anterior treatment. This is how you start getting at the huge population out there with very mild crowding.
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
At the other end, I think we’re working just as hard to try and extend what Invisalign can do and frankly, we’re looking at Japan to help us there. Because most of that population is going to be complex cases that’s going to combine some form of brackets with Invisalign treatment and so there’s a whole range of offerings we’re looking to develop across the kind of value points, from call it performance to value. And we will wrap kind of differing levels of different kinds of services, support, practice development, all the kinds of things we can do to help a practice really grow with Invisalign.
So, I think there’s the core product, the aligners packaged in a way that fits case complexity and the practice dynamics and then there’s the extended product that we wrap all around that and those things are both variables that we can play with.
So, I think, over time, where today most of our volume is full arch/dual arch treatment. I mean, we say we have multiple offerings, but the reality is that’s mostly it. Over time that’s going to change and I think that’ll help ignite market growth. But again, I don’t want to get into numbers yet. It’s way too early to talk about that.
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
We’ve done it. I’m ready to talk about this publicly. We’ve done very detailed consumer and channel work to look at those points of resistance. But again, given that we’re in a competitive environment now, I’m not going to provide any visibility to that, which could describe our strategies. So we do have what we think is a very clear view of what the value proposition is for consumers at differing levels of case complexity and for doctors at differing levels of case complexity and we intend to exploit that.
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
We believe we’re going to be getting back towards being on a full FTE basis, getting staff towards where we were, around 34, maybe a little north of that, on ortho. And we’ll be 65, maybe approaching  on the GP side by the end of the year.
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
No problem.
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
Well, I think those are two pretty different things and let’s maybe look at what problem Europe was trying to solve. Europe is, as we have described over the last couple of years, when we really put--when the Company originally pushed forward in Europe it was kind of a broad, wide push to certify everybody and the hope was that the business would kind of create uplift and grow. What really happened is kind of what we know, which is doctors integrate a product into their practice for a set of clinical and experience and a whole set of reasons and we as a Company hadn’t satisfied those reasons to create that adoption dynamic. So, a lot of what the European team has been successful at over the last year to two years is going back to basics, refocusing on who they call on rather than try to go broad with a lot more certifications. Trying to get the doctors they have trained to start using the product.
And so, rather than just dealing with a price resistance point issue in Europe, their promotions have really been more about getting
doctors to get back to doing cases. If they haven’t done a case in six months or a year, getting them to come to a study club, offering them some promotion to get back to doing Invisalign to develop real experience. That was the problem they were trying to solve.
Now, at the same point, we understand that in any given market there is a value proposition and we have to deliver on that, both in terms of--and we’re at the high end of that value proposition with an $1,800 price. So this is one of the reasons why we try to kind of put platinum service around everything to live up to that value proposition and our biggest challenges are when we’ve got the high price and we don’t live up to it.
And I think I’m going to very specific here. As we look at last year and a couple quarters where we perturbed the market, where we didn’t perform as well as we should have in delivering on that value proposition, what happened? Some doctors cut back on their case volumes. It was like it’s a higher cost and we didn’t live up to their expectations. So the real clear lesson for us is yes we know there’s a value proposition, we know what that envelope is.
We have to perform at the high end of that envelope all the time and we think there’s an opportunity, longer-term, as we automate, drive quality, improve the product, reduce costs, get rid of variability. We think there are opportunities to get substantially more volume with our range of lower priced offerings. So, long way of answering that, sorry Tao.
But there is price resistance even among orthos that are current users and I think, over time as we evolve the product offerings, we’re going to do more volume with them at a lower price.
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
It has crossed our mind, Tao.
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
Yes, we’re on it. Yes.
Tom Prescott Align Technology - President and CEO
I’ll let Eldon comment, because he’s the one that framed the guidance here.
