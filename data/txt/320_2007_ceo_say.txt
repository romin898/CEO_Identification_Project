Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
 
With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO and Jim Dollive our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release was sent out earlier
today and is available on our web site, kraft.com.
As you know, during this call we may make forward-looking statements about the Company's performance. These statements are based
on how we see things today, so they contain an element of uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties,
so please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in the Company's 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more detailed
explanation of the inherent limitations in such forward-looking statements. Some of today's prepared remarks will exclude those items
that affect comparability. These excluded items are captured in our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation within our news release, and they
are also available on our web site.
We'll begin today's call by hearing from Irene who will share her perspectives on our performance in the first quarter. Then Jim will
provide an overview of our financials. After that we'll take your questions.
Before we get started I would like to highlight some changes we've made to the earnings release. We've simplified our discussion of the
key drivers of organic revenue growth and of operating income and earnings. We want to focus more on the underlying health of our
businesses and the factors that are most important to your understanding of our progress against the strategic plan we laid out in
February. We hope you find these changes useful and welcome any feedback you have so we can continue to improve our
communications.
Now, I'll turn it over to Irene.
 
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Thanks, Chris. Good afternoon. As we mentioned in our earnings release today, Q1 was a very eventful quarter for Kraft. We became a
fully independent company on March 30th. I'm happy to report that the transition has been seamless and our 90,000 employees are
eager and energized to write this next chapter in our history. We embarked on our strategic plan to get Kraft growing again and we're
making progress. While our I'll share a few examples today, you'll really start to see more evidence in the back half of the year. And most
important, our earnings met our expectations. We're on track with our programs and our full year guidance is unchanged.
I'd like to share some thoughts about our results in the quarter and how they position Kraft for the remainder of the year. First, the
declines we reported in our earnings and profit margins reflect the necessary planned investments I outlined in February. These
investments are targeted at a number of critical areas, all designed to drive consistent, sustainable growth. As a reminder, we're
investing in quality, to make our foods truly delicious. Marketing spending to provide the necessary support to our base business. And
infrastructure, specifically information systems and expanded distribution in select developing markets.
The second point I want to make is that the early results of these investments in our base business are promising. For example, our
investments in quality and marketing support behind our Mac and Cheese business drove double-digit revenue growth and over  point
of share gain year-to-date. We have now launched DiGiorno Ultimate Pizza into 17% of the U.S. So far, results are ahead of expectations
as we head into our national launch in June. And we're pleased that Oscar Mayer Deli Creation Sandwiches have had excellent
acceptance by the retail trade.
In February I talked about several other initiatives that we're piloting and I'd like to give you a quick update on a few of them. Our Fresh
Creations Prepared Salads are being tested in Boston and Denver. We continue to learn and make the necessary adjustments to our
launch plans to maximize the potential of this new category in our North American business. We're taking our cheese snacking display
test to more than  stores, making it easier for consumers to choose Kraft Cheese when they're looking for healthy, convenient snacks.
And our wall to wall sales initiative is also gaining momentum. We're now rolling it out to stores that account for about 20% of Kraft's
[alt] commodity volume. But we're just getting started.
And while we've had a number of successes to date, we're continuing to address some of the long-standing business challenges that are
impacting our growth. First, we're gaining market share in only about half of our U.S. businesses, in particular, cheese, main stream
coffee and salad dressing shares fell in the quarter. That's unacceptable and we are working on solutions but it will take some time to get
our shares growing more broadly. And while we saw strong results in our international business this quarter, we do have more work to
do.
In sum, I'm encouraged by the signs of progress we're seeing in our results, I continue to be confident that we're on the right track in our
game plan to return Kraft to consistent, predictable growth but it will take some time.
And now I'll turn the call over to Jim.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Good afternoon.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, we have priced a substantial part of our portfolio over the course of the last  months. In this first quarter, we spent a fair amount
back against some of our new item introductions, as well as to protect our merchandising price points for the Easter holiday, and so we
will expect to see greater impacts as we head into the second quarter.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, Alexia, as I said on a couple occasions, our plan as we've laid it out is predicated on organic growth, and I feel very confident that
we can achieve the targets that we've laid out on that basis. Having said that, we will continue to look at opportunities as they arise, and
our focus will be on the opportunity to build scale in international markets, work to gain access to new categories, new capabilities or
new technologies, and so that's what I would say at this point.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
You know what, I'm not really able to give you a specific number, David. But what I will tell you, that a fairly significant portion of the  to
$400 million investment that we have laid out in  is behind quality of a number of our base products. We have been pleased to see
the response as we have made some of those investments in products like mac and cheese and pizza, and you'll continue to see progress
on a number of others as the year progresses. But we really are making investments across the board.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
We ask Mr. Dollive to comment on that one.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Hello, Chris.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, clarify the comment that I made to David. I didn't say the majority of our  to $400 million. I said it was an important part of it. I
want to start there. A big part of it is about marketing and investments behind new initiatives. And, quite frankly, it's a little early for a lot
of that to kick in. You would have seen some increase in our A&C investment in this first quarter, but the bulk of that really will play out in
the course of the year as we actually bring some of these new items and some of our base advertising campaigns to the marketplace.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Again, it's a contributor to our overall performance in terms of operating margins. But it -- a lot of that is just how it's reported as much
as it is the as spent impact on the business.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, you know, I take it -- we will continue to look across our entire business system at opportunities for cost savings. But we have been
very active over the last number of years,  to  years, in fact, in terms of improving the efficiency of our overall supply chain system as
we took Kraft out of the consolidation of a number of our selling organizations, as we globalized our procurement organization and our
IT organization, so, we've realized a number of the efficiencies that other companies are talking about right now, we've realized those
over the course of time. So we will continue to look at those opportunities and we are. But in the near term, I really believe that our
 
selling capability is a source of competitive advantage and that's really our focus, is on how to have a leverage that to help revenue
growth.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
I'll take you questions one at a time. I think the first point is, without a doubt we believe that reinvestment in some of our core businesses
can generate growth. You will see that playing out over the course of the year. In fact, some of the benefits that we're seeing for example
on mac and cheese is not just about the quality investment but it's also then about the marketing investment behind it. And you'll see
that play out on a number of our core businesses. So, without a doubt, those investments will be a key part of our growth plan.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, we said in aggregate that we're targeting over time to get our total A&C to about  to 9% of net revenue, which we believe will put
us at competitive levels. We have not talked specifically about a media target, simply because with the evolving media consumption
patterns of consumers, some of that money is not going to be spent on traditional media.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
You're welcome.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, Ken, just as I answered a moment ago, it's really the quality investment is across the line, because we do believe that the
opportunity to make our foods truly delicious can benefit all of our businesses. The priority, though, that we have given to a number of
our marketing investments is in terms of their ability to over -- to impact the overall business. So the three categories that you've
described are three categories that are very much on our radar screen. I'll tell you that we're feeling very good about our performance on
our meat business, and in fact, I think that in many respects is a model for what we're looking to do in a number of our core categories, as
we thing about broadening the frame of reference, reinvesting in quality and investing in marketing support. So that is a key plank of our
ability to accelerate growth.
 
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
We have not made any formal changes in that regard, David. We are reviewing some proposals with our Board, and we will make those
public as they are approved and we begin to implement them. But our end in mind is to ensure that the performance and the
compensation of our top managers is well aligned with shareholder value.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
No, we actually -- we've got some other issues that are going on in selected marketplaces and we are prepared to address them over the
course of the year.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Robert, it's pretty well spread out over the course of the year, but as you might imagine, some of that investment and the impact of it will
lag a little bit. So for example, as we make some of our quality investments, typically it's going to take a two to three month lag before
you would -- I'm sorry, a two or three quarter lag before you would necessarily see the impact of that investment. So it just -- the
marketplace impact will lag just a little bit.
 
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
On the sales reaction.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
We're feeling very good about the performance of Capri Sun and our entire kid beverage business. We've launched a number of new
products, particularly with anti-oxidants that moms obviously are finding quite desirable and we feel very good about that. We continue
to work on challenges, in terms of the opportunities for Fruit  and some of our other bottled beverages as we look at opportunities in
terms of expanding their distribution.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
I'm not prepared to comment on that today, but as we've talked about that as an issue and an area of opportunity, we're going to
continue to explore a variety of solutions.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
You're welcome.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
I'm not sure we talked specifically about the specific contributions because in any one of these markets obviously it's not necessarily
generalizable. But what I will tell you is that the reason that we're seeing a lift, and we believe it has such promise, is because it will
impact all of those factors. The relationship with the store manager allows for there to be much more merchandising activity on a more
regular basis. It allows us to deal with out of stocks in a more timely fashion. And so, it just all the way around, it allows us, from our
perspective, to get some of the benefits that one would have from a store manager relationship that you typically would see on a DSD
business with a variety of warehouse products.
 
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
I don't want to confuse the statements I've made about our belief that scale can be a competitive advantage because I do believe it can
be with the notion that we're not managing the portfolio. There's no question there are some businesses that have a greater ability to
contribute and those are the one that's we're giving greater investment to. There are others that play a different role. We have some very
high margin, strong cash generating businesses and our opportunity there is to make sure we can continue to protect their margin
generation so that we can use that money to reinvest. So those are not mutually exclusive thoughts. We continue to look at the portfolio
very rigorously with an eye toward understanding which of our brands best fit into our long-term performance goals.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
I hope you'll see it in our results. So as we make these investments I think it will be clear to you where we're choosing to make some of
them. I've certainly signalled a couple of those in February, and I would encourage you to continue to stay focused on what's happening
in our cheese business, what's happening in our snacks business, what's happening in our pizza business and our other convenient
meals. But I think you -- we'll continue to be able to talk to you about where we stand with respect to the portfolio as our thinking
evolves.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
You're welcome.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Hello, John.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
There's no question we feel that we're off to a good start. It's a little hard to quantify the impact of Easter but we believe it would have
had some modest positive impact. But we remain confident that the  to 4% target that we've laid out for the full year is quite achievable.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, I mean, we feel very good about the mix, the performance of mix in driving our overall revenue this quarter. Over time I'm hopeful
that we'll continue to see continued contribution from volume. In the short term it's going to be a little bit depressed by some of the
pricing actions that we're taking, and we're still doing some pruning in a couple of our core businesses, [inevitably] food service. But over
time we're looking to see the combination of volume and mix driving that revenue number and that's what we believe will make it
sustainable.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
[ LAUGHTER ] Thanks very much, John.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Okay.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, actually, at this point, Ken, I touched on it only to say they continue to be challenges. As we look at some of the less favorable
performances in this quarter, we had a couple of hold-overs from the back of 2006. Those are two of them, and I just want to assure you
that we are hard at work in addressing those issues. It will be probably a couple of quarters before we're ready to share with you the
solutions to them.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, I think, for competitive reasons, as you might imagine, I'm reluctant to share any specifics with you until we have begun to trade
release some of these products. So we will certainly talk about them as quickly as we can. I think you've had a bit of a peak under the tent
at some of the new items we've got coming out in cheese. We issued a press release about our -- what we're doing in terms of our FMI
displays, and I think you'll start to see that we've got an exciting pipeline that will start to hit in late Q2, early Q3, and that's why I feel
quite confident that we'll start to see those shares and strengthening in those category performances in the back half of the year.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, I -- we certainly feel that we're off to a good start, Ken. But we're only at the beginning of a three-year plan. I've been quite clear in
saying there is no quick fix. It's a broad portfolio. I think the early stuff is promising. But these initiatives are in the early stages, and I
think as the year progresses we'll have a better sense of how quickly they're catching on.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Over time our intent is to improve the brand equity of all of our core categories, and I believe we've made some important strides over the
last couple of years in terms of just overall closing of the base gaps as well as our investment in quality. So over time we feel very strongly
that our intent is to be able to recognize and realize pricing opportunities across the portfolio.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, no. I think we're going to -- there are some that are stronger today, and as we make the necessary investments, they will then be in
better position for us to be able to price them. So it will not all happen at once. But over time, our expectation is that by adding value to
these core categories, that we will be able to realize the pricing opportunity.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
You're welcome.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Hello, Eric.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, let me make it very clear. We do not think pricing by any means is a layup. I think what we said earlier is that we believe that we can
recover any of the commodity and some of the key input costs through pricing, much more readily than we were able to a couple of years
ago. And I think we all feel very, very strongly about that. That doesn't mean that we do not need to make some necessary investments in
a number of our core franchises, both in quality, as well as in building brand equity in the form of marketing support, as well as in terms
of new product launches to be able to give us the opportunity to really realize the margin opportunity that can come with that.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, you know, again, Eric, I think as we start to look through the various categories in the portfolio, an example like Oreo is we did see
an impact. There will be a bit of a lag. But we feel that that business will recover in a reasonable time frame. We've got a number of new
cheese items, our Live Active line, our probiotics cheeses is coming out in the next couple of weeks. We've got our line of Kraft Selects
that is a real premium offering, and we've got a variety of other new products that we believe are the kinds of items that will allow us to
be able to add value and then realize the pricing opportunities. So, the ones we're talking about are categories that we feel pretty
comfortable, we've got the programming and the necessary investments in place to be able to address them.
 
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, we certainly had some cost challenges in our EU business, which was a big part of the margin impact on the overall category. I
think you're aware, green coffee has increased quite a bit and that played a very important role. But, over time, we've continued to look at
the opportunity to look more broadly at how we can think about some of these portfolios in a broader way in an effort to be able to
capitalize on some of the pricing opportunities that exist, particularly in the higher end of the pricing range in a lot of our core -- in core
categories, particularly like coffee, the chocolate business we're seeing some good early success from some of the value added new
products that we launched -- that we just launched, and we'll be able to realize the benefit, the margin benefit of that a little bit more
over time. So, we did have some challenges in the first quarter, but we really do expect that over time the -- a number of the areas that
we're working on are designed to allow us to be able to realize the margin opportunity from some of those categories.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Very little.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
You're welcome.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Jim, we've chosen not to use that as a metric, simply because that does not speak to the incrementality of that, and so everybody gets
very excited about the fact that they've got a high percentage of new product revenue, and then all of a sudden you discover that your net
hasen't -- your net top line hasn't increased. So, that's what we've been forcing the team to think about the aggregate impact of some of
these new products. I think the challenge is to -- what's the best way to characterize that in a metric is one that we will continue to work
on, because I think it would be helpful for you to have a better sense of how full is the pipeline. But I will tell you that I'm feelings awfully
good about where we are, both in terms of our -- the investments that we're making to fix the base, as well as some of the opportunities
that we're seeing in terms of broadening our frame of reference.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
I would tell you I think as we've laid out our plan, it's going to take all of  for us to begin to see the inflexion point, because we're
making some very significant investments, significant, and I think necessary investments in some of the fundamentals of the business in
order to not only get our base shored up in the short term, but importantly to plant the necessary seeds for some of the trajectory
changing initiatives over the long-term. So I think some of the margin challenges that you saw in the first quarter are going to be with us
for the full year, because of the investments that we're making. But our expectation is, as we head into 2008, as we had laid out, we
expect to see our income growth exceed the rate of revenue growth.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, we're trying really hard to be mindful of the fact that we want to be able to deliver shareholder value while we are investing in the
business. And so we will continue to try to strike the right balance there. But at the end of the day, I believe our shareholders are looking
for long-term sustainable growth, and the best way for us to do that is to make some of these investments in the near term. Both in the
base business, as well as in some of these longer term growth initiatives.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
I guess I'd give you a couple of thoughts here, David. I think, for starters, one of the reasons for us making the  to $400 million
investment is so that we don't have to rob Peter to pay Paul. One of the reasons that some of our new products were not incremental is
because we funded them by taking money off of our base business to invest in the new product. I think the example I talked about quite a
bit was Tassimo. We had lots of challenges on that business, but in particular, we did -- it did force us to take spending off of our base
coffee business, and that didn't serve us well. The second opportunity, though, is to continue to push for more of these ideas to become
broader platforms. And as you see some of the items that will be commercialized in the back half of the year, you will see that there is a
whole pipeline that comes with them, as opposed to it being a single one-off kind of offering. And I believe those two things together is
what will really allow us to have bigger ideas.
And I talked a lot about the things we need to do differently. We've always known what we needed to do. What we've been spending a lot
of time doing is talking about how we're going to get it done. And I think that the investment and this focus on platforms is really the
means by which we can make a lot of our new product ideas much bigger and therefore ultimately more accretive to our overall revenue
performance.
 
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
I guess I'd start by saying that the whole organization is very actively engaged in this task of reframing our categories, and I'm actually
quite pleased by what we're seeing in that regard. We're making some good progress. We've got a number of good initiatives in terms of
helping us identify quality upgrades and opportunities to invest, marketing support in a number of our categories that have had some
long-standing issues. I think we're making some good progress in terms of broadening our frame of reference in our snacks business and
the example I shared at CAGNY in our pizza business.
The reality though is that these new ideas are at various stages of validation with the consumer. And so it's far to early for us to declare a
victory. I think the challenge now is how fast can we validate them and then how quickly can we commercialize them, and that will take
some time, and that's why I keep suggesting that it will take through the back half of the year for us to really fully see the benefits of a
number of these investments.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, Eric, I tell you we are using a variety of tools, some of them the ones that you a alluded to, all with an eye for identifying how best to
manage the portfolio and which are the categories and the brands that we believe can be accretive to our long-term performance, and
that will continue to be the framework that we're going to use to assess the future of our various businesses. We're going to continue to
evaluate these brands and categories in terms of their fit with our overall performance.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
I'd rather not get into the specifics, but I think, as you might imagine, it's the key metrics that really will help us to understand what we
see as the long-term potential of these businesses to be accretive to our overall performance.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Hello, Pablo.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
With respect to the board composition, Pablo, we have made, as part of our preparation for our independent, we made the necessary
changes to our board to be able to have the number -- requisite number of independent directors and to be able to back-fill the seats
that were vacated by a number of the representatives from Altria. We have appointed two new board members, one of whom we hope to
elect at the upcoming meeting -- annual meeting next week, and we are now at our full compliment of independent board members, as
well as the compliment that we feel very comfortable operating with. So I feel very good about the board, and I think it's working well
together, and I think I feel very good about the support that I've received from them. I would tell you that just like every other employee at
Kraft, I need to continue to prove my worth and I intend to continue to stay focused on that. I think some of the programs that we have
laid out, and the plans that we've laid out, are designed to ensure that we are delivering shareholder value and that's what the board is
very much holding me accountable for.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, at the end of the day, I think the focus is going to be our ability to deliver on our commitments. I think, once again, that's the way
that you need to judge us. I feel very good about a lot of the work that was done over the last couple of years. I think it set us up well to be
able to build on where we're going. But I think that single biggest opportunity that we have here is not about what needs to get done.
That has always been undeniable. It's about going about getting it done. And I'm hopeful that as this year progresses, and as we see the
results of over these next couple of years, that our investors will see steady progress in that regard.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
I feel very good about our Oscar Mayer business. I think the revenue growth that we saw from our overall convenient meals was about
5%. I think it's a terrific model of what I would like to see across the Company, and a key driver of that performance has been a number of
 
our new products from the Oscar Mayer group, which includes our Deli Shaved Meats, our Deli Creation Sandwiches and we've got a
pretty robust pipeline as you'll see as the year unfolds. So I feel very good about the progress that we're making, and as well as the steps
we've taken in terms of improving the overall nutritional profile of our Lunchables business, which has contributed to its performance. So
I feel very good about where we are. And as I said before, I feel that it is a very good model for what I would like to see happening more
broadly across the North American business and around the world.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
I would say our key drivers, Pablo, are volume and mix.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
You're welcome.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, first of all, Steven, most of the pricing actions that I've described have been announced already. So it's not -- we've taken them. And
as we said earlier, some of that -- the impact was offset by some of the precise projection we did for some of our Easter merchandising as
well as some of the investments that we made in new products. So, that's pretty much behind us. The opportunity really is the marketing
behind those categories that will come out as the year unfolds and that will be the key driver of our ability to regain our share. But our
focus is on regaining our share. As I said at the outset, we're not where we want to be. We're not where we intend to be. But some of the
challenges, on the share side in particular, are issues that really were lingering from the back half of  and so it will take some time
to be able to work -- to be able to launch the solutions that will address those issues.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Just like to say in sum, this was an eventful quarter for the Company. Our transition to an independent company was seamless. Our
people are energized and hard at work to get the Company growing. We met our performance expectations and we're beginning to
execute our strategies for long-term growth. I am confident that we're moving in the right direction, and though I'm encouraged by our
early progress, as I've said on a couple of occasions, it will take time to restore Kraft to predictable consistent growth. I thank you, and we
look forward to updating you in the coming months.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
 
me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO; and Jim Dollive, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release was sent out earlier
today and is available on our website Kraft.Com.
As you know, during this call, we may make forward-looking statements about the Company's performance. These statements are based
on how we see things today so they contain an element of uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties.
Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in the Company's 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more detailed
explanation of the inherent limitations in such forward-looking statements. Some of today's prepared remarks will exclude those items
that affect comparability. These excluded items are captured in our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our news release and they
are also available on our website.
We'll begin today's call by hearing from Irene who will share her perspective on our second quarter. Then Jim will provide an overview of
our financials, after that we'll take your questions. With that, I'll hand it over to Irene.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we made in the past few
months, both in terms of our second quarter financial results and perhaps of greater importance, in how we're implementing the
transformation plan we laid out in February. Today, I'm even more confident that our plan is sound and that it's execution will enable us
to restore Kraft to reliable growth. I say that for three reasons.
First, our early investments have produced sequential top line improvement. We had solid revenue growth in all major geographies.
Second, while our market share and profit margins are clearly not yet where we want them to be, we are increasingly confident that the
actions we're taking will lay the foundation for improved results. And third, we're taking other significant actions to further enhance
shareholder returns.
 
Let me provide more details starting with the positive impact on our results from our early investments. In North America we delivered
sequential revenue improvement from quarter one to quarter two. That performance was driven by some focused differentiated new
products and incremental marketing investments in powdered soft drinks, pizza, and Oscar Meyer. In January, we launched Crystal Light
with enhanced benefits like immunity, energy, and hydration, these helped to drive trademark sales up 47% in the quarter.
We introduced DiGiorno Ultimate Pizza to you in February. It's now the hottest thing in frozen pizza representing one-third of all new
product sales in the category through June, driving DiGiorno's revenue growth of 12%, and that's even before our national advertising
began last week. We have increased confidence that our new Oscar Meyer deli creations sandwiches have the potential to be $100
million platform and highly incremental to our base business. These sandwiches are a great example of our ability to leverage the power
of our broad portfolio to better compete with foodservice offerings.
In the EU, reinvestment in our core coffee and chocolate brands has resulted in stepped up organic revenue growth, and in developing
markets, our new products, supported by a significant increase in marketing, delivered double digit growth. Net, we feel good about both
our sequential growth from the first to second quarter and our 3.9% organic revenue growth for the first half of the year. We'll also
continue to improve our sales execution and in store presence. We're seeing higher revenue growth in the rollout markets for our wall to
wall sales initiative in North America. In Q3, wall to wall will be in stores that accounts for about 35% of Kraft's all commodity volume.
We have, however, slowed the pace of expansion as we refine our sales rep training for maximum effectiveness and we expect to
complete our rollout by mid 2008.
Despite this early progress on a number of fronts we have not made progress on market share. Through the second quarter, we're
gaining market share in less than half of our U.S. businesses. The investments we are making in the back half will fuel both our top line
momentum and improve our share. We now see a much more robust pipeline of new ideas across the Company, new products, new
packages, and new advertising campaigns, which make us confident to invest at the high end of the  to $400 million range.
Importantly, about half of our investment dollars will go to fix key laggards, including our mainstream coffee business in the U.S., North
American cheese, and snacks. In coffee, our mainstream brands continue to lose share. Later this quarter, we launch a new higher quality
Maxwell House with 100% Aravica beans in a new consumer preferred package.
In cheese, we are not yet comfortable that we've added enough value to our portfolio to manage through record dairy prices. We have a
number of key initiatives in the back half to improve share. These include Live Active probiotic cheeses, premium Kraft Single select and a
new advertising campaign, for base Kraft Singles.
In snacks our growth lags that of the broader snacking world. In the back half, we will launch a robust new product pipeline, invest in
higher marketing spending, and rollout a new Planters campaign to step up our performance. The balance of our spending will go to
accelerate new product and marketing activities in high impact categories like convenient meals where we'll continue to build on the
strong first half momentum. This higher investment coupled with the fact that approximately three quarters of our incremental spending
will occur in the back half of the year, gives us confidence that our share trends will improve especially in the fourth quarter.
Consequently, we are raising our organic revenue guidance to 4% plus for the full year.
Let me now turn to our margin performance. As you know, we had expected margins to decline this year, given our growth investments,
but higher than expected input costs will place even greater pressure on our margins in the back half of the year. That said, we are at the
start of a three year plan.  is a building year, one which will lay a strong foundation for our future growth. We are committed to
investing now because it is essential to driving the accelerated volume growth and stronger product mix that will leverage our overhead
costs and improve margins over time. While making these investments in the business, we are taking other significant actions to enhance
shareholder returns.
Last month, we announced our plans to acquire Danone's global biscuit business. This is a major strategic action that will give us a
platform for greater scale, faster growth, and better margins in our international business. On Monday, Danone reported strong first half
biscuit growth, further evidence that this acquisition will be an important contributor to our growth strategy. We are not finished
reshaping our portfolio. We continue to evaluate our existing brands in the context of our new framework and we'll divest those
 
businesses that don't fit our long term growth plan. We will of course share those decisions with you at the appropriate time.
We're also making better use of our balance sheet capacity. Not only through acquisitions but by executing the $5 billion share
repurchase program we announced in February. In fact during the second quarter we repurchased almost 4% of our outstanding shares
for $2 billion.
In sum, I'm encouraged by the early progress in our transformation plan. We're doing what we said we would do and we are seeing signs
that our investments and efforts will pay off. Of course there's much more to do but I remain confident that we're on the right track, and I
look for accelerated momentum in the back half of 2007, and now I'll turn the call over to Jim.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Thanks, Jim. In sum, during our first few months of independence we made good progress in our plans to transform Kraft. Results from
our early investments are promising. We had strong revenue growth in all major geographies for the first time in a long while. We have a
stronger pipeline of competitively advantaged products that will be launched over the balance of this year and into 2008. We are pricing
to recover the majority of input costs. We are delivering faster savings under our restructuring program and we are looking at additional
opportunities to reduce administrative overhead. We are making the necessary investments for long term growth and have maintained
our full year $1.75 to $1.80 EPS guidance. We would now be happy to take your questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Good morning.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Well, Ken, we're continuing to evaluate all of our brands and categories in the context of the framework that I laid out in February and we
would divest those businesses that don't fit our long term growth plan. And so we're looking at their potential to be able to grow and to
be accretive to our performance over the long term.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Well, we feel very good about our price gaps as we stand here to date. They're much lower than they were a year ago, but I would tell you
that our performance is not just about price gaps. We have some work to do I believe in terms of improving the overall value of our
offerings and that's what the focus of some of the investments that we're making is on.
 
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Well, David, as you know, pricing accounted for about 1.7 points of our revenue growth in this quarter and as we go forward, we expect
that it will play a greater role as we see more price realization. What I have to say is I feel very comfortable that the businesses that we
are pricing are showing some strong performance even in the face of the pricing actions and as a result of that, that's given us confidence
to raise our revenue guidance for the balance of the year.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Well, we continue to be very excited about wall to wall and the entire initiative. I think it's actually one of our best examples of the
opportunity to turn our scale into a competitive advantage. We are seeing higher revenue in our rollout markets and so I continue to be
encouraged about the long term possibilities. I suggested that we hoped to see as much as 0.5 a point of revenue growth over the long
term and I think we're on track to deliver that. The intent though in making sure that we get the training right is that we are asking our
reps to take on a broader portfolio and we are confident that they can do that but we want to make sure as we roll this out that we get it
absolutely right and so we expect to be at about 35% by the end of this quarter as I said and we will complete the rollout by mid 2008.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
I would say this is a classic case where I think we need to just go a little slower to go faster but the net of it is a very significant initiative
and I believe it has the potential to be an important contributor to our long term revenue growth.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
You're welcome.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Good morning, Andrew.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Well, I think it's a terrific first start for a couple of reasons. It gives us another core category in Western Europe which gives us the
potential to be able to invest in infrastructure. I think it helps to improve our margins there and I feel very good about where we are in
terms of our net position in that geography. The other benefit as you know is about its ability to help our position in developing markets
and in that part of the world, we're going to continue to look at opportunities to improve our scale. It's obviously got terrific population in
GDP growth and I believe particularly with our strong biscuit position that we have an excellent platform from which to build.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Good morning, Terry.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Well, we are continuing to evaluate our portfolio as I said. When I rooted out the strategy at CAGNY, Terry, I made it clear that that was
not a Safe Harbor for all of our businesses and we continue to look at them within the context of the framework that we laid out and I
think the question I'm asked most frequently by our investors is what about divestitures and so I think it's important to just be explicit
about how we're thinking about that. Obviously, we will share decisions on that subject with you as those actions are completed, but it's
not a change in our position. It's really just a clearer articulation of how we're thinking about it.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
You're welcome.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Good morning, David.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Well, actually, David I would say at this point we're looking at something considerably smaller than that. I think we've got a lot of our
major activity behind us. We will continue as I've said to look at individual categories and make those decisions and clearly to the extent
that they create some overhead issues, we will deal with those as part of our overall assessment of the opportunity, I think we will
continue to look at the reshaping of the portfolio but our focus really is on generating organic growth and following the four strategies
that we laid out.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Well, David, as I said at the outset and it is part of the reality of timing, we expect, we've always expected our results to improve in the
back half of 2007, partly because that was where the bulk of our spending was going to hit and that was when many of our new products
were going to hit. We have a much stronger pipeline in the back half of  than we did a year ago and I feel good about that.
Having said that I am disappointed in our North American particularly U.S. market share performance. Some of those issues though are
some businesses that have been issues for quite some time and I think that the difference here is that we are facing those issues and
we're dealing with them. I've talked about some of the actions that we're taking on cheese, on coffee, on snacks, and even pizza which
has some very very strong revenue growth, we are year-to-date losing share in that business and we expect that we will see recovery in
the back half. So I don't feel good about our share performance. There's no question that it's not where we want it to be, but we do expect
to see overall improvement in the second half especially Q4 as our new items hit and we benefit from the incremental spending that is
yet to come.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
You're welcome.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Good morning.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Actually, Chris, about a third of it is investments in quality and about two-thirds of it is in marketing and infrastructure.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
That's correct. That's not the total.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
No, actually, we've said volume is still not where we want it to be. It's actually a combination of factors. The biggest is our continued
pruning in foodservice which is still a head wind for us, represented about 1.5 point on the sector in the quarter so it's an issue. We
continue to have some chronic problems in a couple of core categories that we are addressing but we do expect to see volume
improvement in the back half driven by the programming that we've put in place, and as I said before, I actually feel encouraged by the
fact that our volume has held up reasonably well on those businesses that we've priced, so we do expect to see some volume recovery in
the back half of the year and I believe the programming that we've got in place will be a key part of that.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
You're welcome.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Well first of all, Jonathan, reiterate the fact that our plan is predicated on organic growth and the guidance that we've laid out there is
really predicated on our belief that the strategies that we've laid out can help to accelerate growth in our core categories and I think we're
starting to see some early impact of those, of that thinking and those investments. Having said that, we will continue to look for
opportunities to expand our footprint as well as to accelerate growth, and certainly the Danone Biscuit is a part of our overall desire to
accelerate growth and as I mentioned their first half revenue was up about 5% and we believe that that can definitely be accretive to our
performance and particularly as we start to look at some of the synergy opportunities. We will continue to look for opportunities to
add-on businesses that we think can further help to accelerate our growth. Okay, and secondly, when you think about wall to wall, I
know, could you talk about what the deliverables are as far as I know it's not something that's being looked at as a way to reduce costs
across your sales and marketing organization. A year from now, let's say wall to wall is half or more of your stores. What can we look for
as specific evidence that that program is working and is transforming your U.S. performance in a way that's meaningful for investors?
Well, I'll tell you what the criteria are for our guys. It is going to be accelerated revenue growth and stronger share performance and
those are very clear and simple metrics. They all understand exactly what they are looking to do and as I mentioned the early results in
the rollout markets are encouraging. But importantly--.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
On those two metrics but importantly we're only in less than 35% today. We will be up to 35% by the end of the quarter. So it's going to
take a little bit of time until we see that performance more broadly across the portfolio, but we certainly believe that this is an important
enabler to our acceleration of our overall top line growth.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Well, Jonathan, over 100% of our shares have actually traded since the spinoff, and so critically important that I continue to stay in touch
with our investor base and I will continue to do so. I think it's very helpful to understand how they feel about our overall strategies and to
make sure that they understand the context and the progress that we're making so it's an important part of my ability to be able to return
Kraft to reliable growth.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
You're welcome.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Good morning, Eric.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Yes, that's what I said, Eric.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Yes.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Well, Eric, as we mentioned we're very pleased with the progress we're making against our overall restructuring plan and we are
delivering greater savings at a faster pace than we had anticipated. We're going to continue to look at opportunities to drive our
administrative costs down and I am hopeful that as we continue to look at opportunities to simplify the organization that we will find
some additional opportunities for overhead savings.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Thank you.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Good morning, Eric.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Yes. In fact that's why divestitures is not a major part of our plan. I feel very comfortable that we have the ability to better leverage the
breadth of our portfolio and that's a critical piece of our strategy going forward. I think our scale can be a competitive advantage but
having said that to the extent that we have businesses that we don't believe can be accretive over the long term, we are better to put our
investments elsewhere and obviously we will consider all opportunities to do that to be able to maximize shareholder value and the tax
implications is an important consideration in that equation.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
I actually don't think there's a long term problem. I think the issue has been we have been far too focused on commodity costs and price
gap as our lever and the reality is it's a growth category, consumers around the world are eating more and more cheese and we're not
participating, and so as I said before, I'm not yet comfortable that our pipeline on cheese is robust enough in general and certainly to
handle these record high dairy costs, but we are about fixing it. It's just going to take us some time because there's just not enough in the
pipeline. We've got a couple of good items coming out in the back half. I've talked about the Live Active product, our Kraft Singles Select
product, we've made some changes in our advertising agency that I think will lead us to a stronger program for our base singles product
but net-net, we need to get some more innovative products coming out and it will take us some time to do it but clearly cheese is one of
those categories where we have the right to win and we will.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Good morning.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Actually, Alexia, we continue to believe that Tassimo is an important growth engine for us as we go forward. In fact, the fact that we've
chosen to go to a more targeted strategy particularly in North America is paying dividends on the bottom line and it's one of the factors
that contributed to our strong performance in our beverage segment so I believe that the targeted strategy is paying dividends. We
actually expect our Tassimo platform to grow about 70% this year, but we're focused on the right people. We're not trying to appeal to
the mass market. It's about targeting coffee Aficionados. We've got some exciting new products in the EU like Latte Macchiato and that's
performing quite well for us. We've got some new advertising that is coming out in the back half of the year and actually I'm quite
encouraged by the program that is setting up for our Christmas season this year.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
You're welcome.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Good morning, David.
 
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
David, we're choosing to look at the top revenue contributors because what I found before, the Top  is an important metric but the fact
was they were growing and we had a leaky bucket. So I think the relevant consideration is what percent of our revenue is growing and as I
mentioned, less than half of our revenue is growing share, and that is unacceptable. We expect to see that number go considerably North
over time and in fact, we should see some improvement in the back half of this year particularly in the fourth quarter.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Well, David we've priced about 60% of our North American portfolio in the last  months and as we mentioned earlier, I expect to see
even more realization of that pricing in the back half of the year, so we believe that we will be able to recover a significant portion of our
input costs through the pricing actions we've taken. Having said that, it's more than we've been able to do in the past but it still is not
sufficient to offset the entire impact.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Thanks, David.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Yes, we have.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Well, basically we told you we took a pricing action earlier in the year and then we took another one effective July 9, and so we are getting
ourselves through the 4th of July holiday.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Yes. I think it's as you heard Jim say, we expect it will get somewhat worse before it gets better as the higher input costs flow their way
through the P&L, particularly in the third quarter.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
You're welcome.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
No, actually, I would say it was the plan in the sense that we understood that a number of the new items and some of the marketing
ideas that this spending is going to go against would not be ready until the back half and that's one of the reasons I've been saying all
along that we expected to see stronger recovery in the back half, and so that's the reason for the spending coming more sharply in the
back half than it has so far.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
I certainly can, Pablo. I think it should be somewhat clear from my remarks I feel very good about our progress on powdered beverages.
We're beginning to see some progress on coffee and I think we're addressing an issue that's been longstanding so I feel good about
beverages. I feel very good about our position in convenient meals. On the top line we've got some work to do there in terms of margins
which will recover as the year progresses. So I think beverages and convenient meals are our strongest performers and have the
strongest pipeline.
The balance of our sectors, particularly cheese, snacks, and grocery are the areas that we continue to have some issues but rest assured,
we are on top of what those key issues are. It's just going to take somewhat longer for us to be able to address some of them but the
progress will accelerate in the back half, as I've said three quarters of our spending is yet to come. We do have a stronger new product
pipeline across-the-board which you'll have much more visibility to as these products come out into the marketplace. I expect to see
better pricing realization and all of which will, I believe will lead to improved share as well as volume performance.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Well, I know I actually think that the opportunity we have is to be able to get stronger volume performance from the premiums that we
have. I think over time, clearly as we add more value to a number of our products particularly in cheese and nuts as you suggest, that will
help us, but the real opportunity we have is to be able to generate stronger performance and particularly stronger share performance
with the gaps that we have today and that will hinge entirely on our ability to restore brand equity to a number of these iconic brands and
to innovate with value-added products and that's really what our investment plan is focused on.
 
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Yes, we are continuing to search. It's a critically important role for us particularly as I'm looking to place much more emphasis on the
consumer and the quality of our marketing. We've been actively engaged in an external search and I expect to make an announcement
later this quarter.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Well, again, Steven, I think we have to stop talking only about price gaps as the root of our issues. There's no question that we're not
happy with our share performance on cheese. We do feel that our price gaps for the most part are in a reasonable place, and so I don't
believe that that is the solution to our long term opportunity. The issue is really about the quality of our pipeline and the ability to
introduce value-added new items, and that's what we've got the team focused on. So I don't think it's about price gaps. Certainly, getting
better price realization and seeing how the marketplace reacts in general to these higher input costs will be important and may create
some relative dislocation in our position but I feel generally quite good about where our pricing position is on cheese. The issue is the
ability of the portfolio to add enough value to be able to be distinguished and competitively advantaged.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
Well, I think we're making good progress. We're not exactly where we need to be but I will tell you over the coming weeks we will be
talking at the back-to-school conference about a number of our new items and we're just beginning to present them to the trade so I
come back to the point I knew that it was going to take us some time in  to get this pipeline jump started and that's why we've been
talking about the fact that we expect to see stronger acceleration in the back half. Having said that, our early investments are already
showing some results, so it will take us some time as we've said particularly on some of the longstanding issues in some of our core
categories, those are a little harder to fix and we are in the process of doing that and we will lay those out as we commercialize them in
the marketplace, but I will tell you overall, I think the organization is responding very well to the overall charge of moving faster, of being
bolder, of taking some actions, of testing and learning and I'm seeing examples across the Company of progress there and it will be more
visible to you as these new products begin to come out in the back half of the year.
 
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - CEO
You're welcome.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
 
me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO; and Tim McLevish, our Chief Financial Officer.
Our earnings release was sent out earlier today and is available on our website, Kraft.com. As you know, during this call we may make
forward-looking statements about the Company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today, so they contain
an element of uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainty. Please refer to the cautionary statements and
risk factors contained in the Company's 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more detailed explanation of the inherent limitations in such
forward-looking statements. Some of today's prepared remarks will exclude those items that affect comparability. These excluded items
are captured in our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our news release and they are also available on our website. We'll begin
today's call with Irene's perspective on our third quarter. Then Tim will provide an overview of our financials and results of operations.
After that, we'll take your questions. With that, I'll hand it to Irene.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Thanks, Chris. Good morning. As we reported in this morning's press release, we posted organic revenue growth of just over 6% in Q3
and EPS X items that were $0.02 lower than the prior year. Broadly speaking, our top line growth is stronger than I would have expected
at this point our transformation plan. At the same time, higher input costs and the impact on our margins are a bigger challenge than I
would have anticipated.
To be more specific, I'm encouraged that our top line momentum continues to build and that our businesses are responding to the
growth initiatives we launched earlier this year. We had three consecutive quarters of improved organic net revenue growth and in Q3,
revenue growth accelerated in every geography. I'm especially pleased that we also had solid volume gains, despite significant price
increases. That's a clear sign that our brand equity is strengthening.
In businesses where our investments in quality, marketing, and new products have had time to gain traction, we generated solid volume
 
mix gains and captured market share, despite price increases. Prime examples are mac and cheese, cold cuts, and cookies. And a
number of the new products we've launched this year promise be sizable businesses and highly incremental to our base. These include
Oreo Cakesters, Live Active cheeses, Easy Mac cups, ultimate pizza, and deli creation sandwiches. In fact, we expect the revenue
contribution from new products in  to be more than 30% higher than 2006.
Our growth initiatives in our focus categories are also beginning to generate share gains. In Q3 we gained share in 47% of our North
American business. Versus only 38% for the trailing  weeks. That's not yet where we need to be. We expect to have over 50% of our
revenues growing share in the near term, and at least two-thirds longer term. But we're moving in the right direction and you should see
further improvements as more programs hit the market in the fourth quarter.
Highlights include new campaigns for Maxwell House, behind our advantage product and package and Planters, capitalizing on the
natured goodness of this iconic snack brand. We'll also have a further step-up in spending on our international growth initiatives. As our
wave one investments gain traction in the marketplace, I remain confident that this will set the stage for continued top line momentum
and share gains into  and beyond.
Despite our progress on the top line and in market share, we still have some significant challenges. The biggest is our margin
performance. We're in a much tougher input cost environment than we had expected. In the quarter, gross margins declined  basis
points, even after pricing actions and manufacturing productivity. Frankly, we haven't yet rebuilt the brand equity of our portfolio to the
point where we can fully recover input cost inflation through a combination of pricing and productivity. This has been particularly true in
our North American cheese business where dairy costs in the third quarter were up 40% versus prior year and current spot prices are not
reflecting their historical seasonal decline, leading to record high average barrel cheese costs for 2007.
The easy thing to do would be to cut our investments in growth to improve our near term profit margins. But as I said last quarter, the
input cost environment will not change our plans to make the necessary investments to improve the quality of our products and to
rebuild the equity of our brands. These investments are essential to adding value to our products and therefore to our ability to manage
input cost inflation over the long-term. Our investments are also key to driving the accelerated volume growth and stronger product mix
that will leverage our overhead costs, lead to higher operating margins, and restore Kraft to reliable growth.
In the face of these extraordinary cost increases, we're also taking more aggressive actions to reduce our overhead costs. To date we've
been able to achieve savings at a faster rate while incurring less expense. Cumulative savings under our restructuring program are now
expected to reach $775 million this year, versus our expectation of $700 million at the start of the year. And there's more to come.
Looking at our total restructuring program, we expect to come in at the same cost and reach higher savings than the $1 billion originally
expected.
If you recall in September, as part of our strategy to rewire the organization for growth, I announced a new organizational structure to
replace key resources closer to the market, increase accountability, speed decision making, and streamline headquarters. We have now
defined the structure, identified the accountable business units and named the leaders of those units. Based on the work to date, I'm
even more convinced that our new structure and new leadership team will simplify our operations and increase our agility and
competitiveness in the marketplace.
As you might have seen on Monday, we named Mary Beth West as our new Chief Marketing Officer. As head of North American
beverages, Mary Beth helped develop our successful go to market strategy for Tassimo in the U.S. and engineered the reawakening of
our Maxwell House brand that has just hit the market. She brings a strong consumer centric approach to business challenges and will
play a key role in helping to upgrade the capabilities of our marketing teams and improve the effectiveness of our programs. We still have
a few more personnel holes to fill, including a new leader for our North American cheese business and we'll be in a better position to
quantify the incremental savings from these actions as we exit the year and put the new structure in place in early 2008.
Finally, we continue to take the necessary steps to strengthen our portfolio. To exit businesses where we do not have a clear competitive
advantage so that we may allocate our capital and management resources to those businesses that can grow and generate attractive
returns for our shareholders. Specifically, we've just closed the sale of our Fruit2O and Veryfine bottled beverage assets we're on track to
 
close the acquisition of Danone biscuits by year end.
In sum, I'm encouraged by the continued progress in the early stages of our transformation plan. We're doing what we said we would do
and we are seeing signs that our efforts and investments are paying off. We still have a number of challenges but we are addressing
them. And I remain confident that we are on-track to restore Kraft to reliable growth. And now I'll turn the call over to Tim.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Thanks, Tim. In sum, from an overall perspective, I feel good about our business momentum and the early returns from our growth
initiatives. We can see that our investments in quality, marketing, and new products are driving improved organic growth. We're
generating solid volume and mix gains despite significant price increases and we're beginning to leverage our cost savings. We still have
challenges, particularly in the face of higher input costs, but we're making the necessary investments for long term growth and have
maintained our full year EPS guidance of $1.80 to $1.82. I remain confident that our transformation plan will maintain our top line
momentum and deliver improved margins in 2008. We'd now be happy to take your questions.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Hello.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
We haven't actually quantified the pieces that went into each of the quarters, Alexia, but as I said, our spending is back half loaded and it
will be a combination of Q3, Q4 with more of it skewing to Q4, which is why we're anticipating continued progress on our share growth in
Q4.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, as we said, we're covering only about half of our costs at this point. It's primarily an issue related to dairy and it has a lot to do with
the strength of our brand equity and that's why we continue to make the necessary investments. As we look forward to the fourth quarter,
I think it's going to look a lot like the third quarter. We should continue to see strong top line momentum and continued pressure on
margins. But as we exit this year, as we've discussed, I believe we have programs in place that will allow us to make the kind of gains in
our operating margins that we had given in our guidance.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Good morning, Steven.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, again, Steven as we said, our focus is going to be to continue to make the necessary investments in the business and you're seeing
that going through. We are continuing to work, though, to offset some of the other input costs. Some of the input cost with continued
focus on overheads and so that what you're beginning to see in this quarter is indicative of what we're going to continue to push on going
forward. If you remember our fundamental growth formula, it is for pricing and productivity over time to offset input cost and to use
volume growth and mix together with a continued focus on overhead cost savings to increase operating margins. So we're seeing some of
the early benefit of that. We expect that we'll continue to benefit more from the overhead opportunity in 2008.
 
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
I would argue that we're actually seeing better pricing realization as we have come out of the third quarter than we've seen in quite some
time and I've been particularly pleased by the fact that our volume and mix have held up in the face of that. As we exit the year, we will
continue to see the impact of pricing as it plays through on a number of our categories. But there is no question that we are in somewhat
unchartered water on a number of these categories as we reflect the impact of input costs through the P&L.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
No, we're not prepared to provide that number at this time, Eric, but again, I'll tell you that particularly as we look at some of the
launches that are pending, our Maxwell House reawakening program, our Planters campaign launch, a number of other programs on
both cheese and biscuits, we are looking to see a continued increase in our spending in the fourth quarter.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
It's a little bit hard to quantify. Certainly, it is a piece of the impact on our gross margins. It's probably about a quarter of our $400 million
incremental cost. But the end result here is the fact that as I mentioned, we're seeing a considerable step-up in the percent of our
products that are rated superior to competition. As we go forward, that will continue to be a key driver of our performance and we're
seeing the benefit in select categories like Mac and Cheese, where we have made those kinds of investments, we're seeing the impact of
that investment in the marketplace.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
That's correct.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
We continue to feel good about the program. We are learning, continuing to learn about how best to train our sales reps but we expect to
be national by mid-2008 and we are on track.
 
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
I think certainly, Eric, some of the past history is applicable and we are seeing in selected categories again, particularly cheese, where the
costs are most extreme, we are seeing some tradedown and it comes back to our need to continue to make the necessary investments in
brand equity to be able to add enough value to be able to justify our price premium. But having said that, there are a number of factors,
despite the fact that as we look at the dairy market, we see some of the traditional metrics all going in the right direction, number of
cows, milk production, milk per cow, all of those traditional metrics that we look at that would lead to declining dairy prices at this time
of year, we're not seeing that happening. That reflects the fact that there really are some changes happening in the marketplace, as Tim
mentioned. So as we move forward here, some of the impacts are somewhat unchartered and we just need to continue to be prepared to
address them, which is why we are so focused on continuing to build brand equity, while driving down costs.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, as you might expect, it's a little early for us to give a firm number on 2008. We obviously will do that in our fourth quarter call. But
as Tim said, we expect to grow margins in  as we committed in February, despite the input costs and it's really going to come from
the fact that we're going to see the benefits of our wave one investments, plus some of the beginning of the wave two investments that
we're now making as well as the impact of the accelerated restructuring savings. So that's what will contribute to our operating leverage
in 2008.
 
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
I would tell you -- we haven't quantified that, Andrew, but I would tell you this is not about pipeline. This is about take-away and the
contribution of some of these core businesses that I mentioned in my earlier remarks to our overall performance. I feel very comfortable
that the volume gains that we'er seeing are sustainable and real and in fact will continue to build into 2008.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
I think the visibility is still pretty high. I feel good about the progress that we've made. As you rightly say, over the last couple of years we
benefited from cleaning out some of the less profitable pipes of the portfolio. We've got most of that behind us, though at this point. And
so the mix that we're looking at is about the higher margin that comes from competitively advantaged concepts like Cakesters, like Live
Active cheeses, for example, that will allow us to realize higher margins in our snacks business, these 100-calorie packs and our toasted
chips have very attractive margins.
 
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Good morning, David.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
David, as I laid out the strategies in February, I made it clear that they were not meant to be a Safe Harbor for all of our businesses and
we've given each of our businesses the charge in the face of those four strategies to take a look at what the long term growth prospects
look like. We've been very clear to say that the three criteria we are looking at in terms of the potential divestiture is growth potential,
relative market share, and overall profitability and we will continue to use those as our screens. Certain of our categories are better
positioned to be able to -- with this new framework, to be able to make progress and be accretive over the long-term. Obviously, as we
have news to announce on that front, we will give it to you.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Yes. Well, as we mentioned, Pablo, we've been quite aggressive in our price increases on our cheese business. We've priced over 80% of
the portfolio anywhere between  and 13%. We continue to have a premium on virtually every form that we make. So it's not about our
shyness as the market leader in terms of a willingness to take pricing. Having said that we're also well aware of the fact that we need to
make sure that we are justifying the prices that we're charging and we haven't, across the portfolio yet added enough value to be able to
be even more aggressive in those price increases. I think we're beginning to see some of the impact in the kinds of items that we have
launched, the Live Active cheeses, our single select product, and some of the marketing actions that we've taken on our base businesses.
But bottom line, quite frankly, we need some new thinking on our cheese business and we've been making some key leadership changes
over the course of these last few months in an effort to help that business realize the potential that I know it has.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, basically, we just, as Mary Beth West moved into our CMO role, we have back filled Mary Beth with Bob Levi, who is a beverage
veteran, been with the Company over  years and has made some significant contributions and he will pick up that business as we move
forward. As you say, we -- Chris Baldwin has joined us on our snacks business and I am quite confident that he will help us to access what
we believe to be terrific opportunity on the snacks front. Our cheese leadership is open right now. We have been public in terms of
looking on the outside. I really do want to get some new thinking on that business and in the meantime, [Nick Maragioli], who has been
running our Convenient Meals business, has stepped in to serve as the interim leader there. Cheese is really at this moment the only one
of our businesses that is open. Ronda Jordan is still very -- managing our grocery business quite effectively and we're beginning to see
good progress as we improve the relevant and the contemporariness of that business.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
The way you should think about that, Pablo, is that we are sequencing our investments. As I said at Back to School, we have chosen to
focus on the categories that matter most and the five categories that I laid out there were about 50% of our revenue. As we continued to
make improvements in pourables, for example, that will further add to our overall investment. But the reality is, we can sequence these
investments and start to get the impact while we then make the next range met phase of investment. So with investments in these five
core categories, we have seen a significant step-up in our revenue growth, our organic revenue as we said is up over 6% in this quarter.
And so I am confident that by focusing our investments on the areas that can have the greatest leverage, we will be able to make
progress but we will eventually get to all of the businesses in the portfolio that need support.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Nine is the number for the full year, Ken.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
No, we've been very diligent in managing our price gaps and I feel very comfortable that we're in a much stronger position with respect to
our gaps than we have been historically and we are not going to allow ourselves to get out of the proper range, which is why we need to
continue to ensure that we've added enough value to the portfolio and that is the focus of the investments that we're making.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
I think it's the opportunity to approach the category from a consumer perspective as I laid out in February. I continue to feel very strongly
that cheese is a growth opportunity for Kraft. As we look around the world, consumers are eating cheese. It's growing at a very healthy
rate. And our opportunity is to ensure that our offerings within the category are preferred and I think the key to that is to take a more
consumer centric approach to the category and both through our marketing efforts as well as our new product innovation.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
It just wasn't -- you should interpret nothing. It simply was not a significant contributor to the overall results of our snacks segment and
that's why we didn't mention it.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
A number of our businesses, frankly, on the top line are performing at an acceptable level. As we look across the portfolio I'm quite
pleased by the performance of most of our categories, both in North America and around the world. As we mentioned we have seen
accelerated revenue growth in all geographies. So I feel very good about that. I would say within North America, our Convenient Meals
business was up 8% and if you look at under the covers and look at the contributors to that growth, it's about quality, it's about
marketing investment, it's about new product innovation and that is the formula for our future. So I believe that is our model and as we
move through the various parts of the portfolio, that is the formula that we're looking for.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Absolutely.
 
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, without a doubt, of all the categories in which we compete, private label is a bigger factor in cheese than it is in our other
categories. So you start there. The reality is that to the extent that some of our offerings within the category are not well-differentiated. It
puts pressure on our ability to price at a very significant premium. We're still at considerable premiums within each of our forms today
but the issue will be can we command an even higher premium. I come back to the fact that products like Live Active have about a 13%
margin advantage to our base product. And it's the opportunity to leverage some proprietary technology that goes into the making of
that product, together with our marketing opportunities, that then allow us to be able to command higher prices going forward.
But the reality is absolute price points do matter as well. So part of the challenge in cheese is that the entire category is down as the
consumer absorbs some of the extraordinary impact of these input costs.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Actually, I think one of the benefits of the breadth of our portfolio is that we expect that that can benefit virtually all of our products. As
we continue to think about a consumer centric approach to them and what we need to do to help to make them more relevant to today's
consumer. Virtually every one of our segments can benefit from that move from away from home to at home consumption.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
We'll update you as part of our  guidance but we are on track for our year-end closing. They continue to report strong performance
on their biscuit business. As you know, their Q3 growth was almost 7%. So it's a healthy business. Clearly the impact of grains will have
some impact. But there are some very strong productivity programs in place and I'm pretty confident that we will be able to continue to
benefit from the accretion that we have laid out for you.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
I think the better indication is what happened to our snack business domestically. Without a doubt it did take a hit in margin. As we
mentioned though, we are looking at a variety of actions, including pricing, trade spending, and productivity to help to manage that
going forward and I'm confident that we will be able to do that.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
I feel very confident that it is about the marketing programs. One of the key metrics that we look at as we are rolling out wall to wall is
the performance of our base biscuit program versus the performance of the warehouse products. And we've continued to see strong
incremental growth in the wall to wall markets, and as we look at the base businesses, I'm confident that this has not had an impact on
-- adverse impact on the biscuit business. That's one of our most important criteria as we roll this thing out.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Good morning, Edgar.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Yes. When we talked about input costs it's not just the raw material input cost. It's the knock on effect on resins and packaging costs as a
consequence of the high energy prices. So it's an aggregate assessment.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, as you are aware, one of the most significant changes we made this year was to focus our Tassimo marketing efforts to a more
targeted audience and to look at more targeted marketing approaches to that audience and so we are seeing the benefits of that. Our
Tassimo business is up almost 70% and at a considerably lower cost than we had year -- than we had a year ago.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods - Chairman, CEO
Well, as we said when we laid out the plan in February, this is a three-year plan. Our target in terms of our overall A&C investment is to
get to us the competitive levels of  to 9% over time and we are committed to making progress against that objective and so as we exit
2007, we will have made progress. We will make continued progress in 2008. And we are looking to then drive our other aspects of the
P&L, particularly overhead cost, as our means, together with volume growth, and mix improvement to drive our overall operating
margins. So you will see continued investment in the business in  but we are committed to making margin improvement as we said.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
 
With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO, and Tim McLevish, our Chief Financial Officer.
Our earnings release was sent out earlier today and is available on our Web site, kraft.com. Also available on our Web site are slides that
we will refer to during our prepared comments.
As you know, during this call, we may make forward-looking statements about the Company's performance. These statements are based
on how we see things today, so they contain an element of uncertainty.
Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties, so please refer to the cautionary statement and risk factors contained
in the Company's 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more detailed explanation of the inherent limitations in such forward-looking statements.
Some of today's prepared remarks will exclude those items that affect comparability. These excluded items are captured in our GAAP to
non-GAAP reconciliations within our news release and they are also available on our Web site.
Today's agenda is as follows: We'll begin the call with Irene providing her perspective on our  results and the outlook for 2008, then
Tim will highlight our financials then review the results for each of our business segments. After that, we'll take your questions.
With that, I'll hand it off to Irene.
 
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone.
Turn to Slide 4. As you saw in our press release,  represented a solid start to our three-year plan and more importantly, established
good momentum for 2008. Our organic revenue growth of 6% in Q4 and 5% for the full-year was even better than we had expected and
it was quality growth.
We had solid gains from product mix throughout the year and volume growth improved as the year progressed. That reflects the payback
from the investments with we made in the course of the year. Where we have improved quality, invested in base brand support and/or
innovated, we've seen good results and so I remain confident that our plan will return Kraft to reliable growth.
Turning to Slide 5. We continue to see this model at work in the wave one investment areas I discussed in September. In our mac and
cheese business, we invested in quality upgrades to our base products and rolled out Easy Mac Cups.
The result, we posted double-digit organic growth and gained a half point of market share in 2007. This followed three years of
essentially no growth and more than point of share loss.
Our pizza business finished the year absolutely on fire. It posted double-digit volume growth and gained over  market share points in
the fourth quarter.
And our back to basics approach in the EU focused on our two iconic brands, Jacobs coffee and Milka chocolate, delivered a fourth
consecutive quarter of solid organic revenue growth. For a business that had been flat to down for the past four years, the 3.5% organic
growth in  is no small feat.
I'm also encouraged by the early results in three core categories where our programming hit late last year. Coffee where we're adding to
our success in the premium segment by beginning to stem our long-standing decline in mainstream coffee. The reason, our recent
relaunch of Maxwell House with quality upgrades in product and packaging.
In biscuits where our market share performance improved in the fourth quarter from several new product platforms and in cheese, where
despite record high dairy costs in the second half of 2007, we increased our marketing more than 50% in processed slices and introduced
Singles Select. That helped to reverse our share declines on processed cheese from the first half of the year.
We also delivered double-digit growth and market share gains in snacking cheese and our new LiveActive cheeses are proving to be
highly incremental both to Kraft and to the category. There's still much more to be done in cheese but I feel we're off to a good start.
Turning to Slide 6. More broadly across North America as our investments hit the market our market share trends have begun to
improve. On a trailing 52-week basis, we finished the year with businesses representing 47% of our revenue, gaining or holding share,
not yet where we want to be but that's up from only 38% three months earlier.
And in the fourth quarter, we gained or held share in businesses representing 50% of our revenue. Over the course of  we'll continue
to improve on that trend. We are finally on our way to our longer-term goal of growing share in at least two-thirds of our revenue base.
Turning to Slide 7. Also in 2007, we put strong new leadership in place. Four of the nine members of my executive team are new to the
Company or to their jobs and we've replaced half of our key business leaders around the world.
We changed our incentive systems to more directly tie executive rewards to shareholder value creation and we're now executing a
reorganization to give more accountability to our business leaders while significantly reducing overhead costs.
We've also strengthened our portfolio. We're exiting businesses that don't fit our long-term growth plan like Fruit 2.0 and Post cereals.
 
And we're enhancing our future growth prospects, profitability and international footprint with the acquisition of the Danone biscuit
business.
Finally, I'm pleased to say we delivered at the high end of our increased EPS guidance. Yes, we did benefit from a lower tax rate but this
was on top of better top line momentum from our investments in brand equity. At the same time, higher than expected input costs
negatively impacted our margins and put pressure on the bottom line and so in response, we took more aggressive actions to reduce our
overhead costs.
Turning to Slide 8. As you saw in our press release this morning, in  we'll spend less and save more on our restructuring program
than originally anticipated.
We now expect $200 million more in savings and our cost to deliver those savings will be $200 million less. Our spending on the
program will end in 2008, but incremental savings will continue beyond that.
Clearly, we made significant progress on many fronts in 2007. Turning to Slide 9. However, not everything went our way. The biggest
surprise was the unprecedented high dairy costs and the fact that they remained at these high levels through year-end.
As you can see from this chart, the  price curve broke significantly from historical normals. As a matter of practice given historical
cyclicality, we typically price to the expected average, not the peak dairy costs, in any given year. As a result, when cheese costs stayed
high late into the year, our pricing actions did not keep pace with costs, therefore, we're taking additional pricing actions now.
We do expect some moderation in average cheese costs later this year. Nevertheless, as you can see, we're likely to face difficult cost
comparisons through the first half of the year, which brings me to our  guidance.
Please turn to Slide 10. Since this is the second year of a three-year plan, let me start with the expectations I laid out last February at
CAGNY. At that time, I said in  our operational turnaround will continue to gain momentum as we get growing again on both the
top and bottom lines, our top line will grow  to 4% organically and operating income growth will exceed revenue growth.
I said we'd continue to invest a portion of our growth back into the business as we launch the next wave of trajectory changing initiatives,
and we'd further accelerate our advertising and consumer spending toward our long-term target of  to 9% of net revenue.
I also said that by  we'd hit our stride. We'd fully realized the financial benefits of our investments and deliver our long-term targets
of at least 4% organic net revenue growth and  to 9% EPS growth.
So, how do I feel about those statements today? Turn to Slide 11. I stand firmly behind them. I feel good about our momentum and I'm
even more bullish as we enter year two of our three-year plan.
Looking at the numbers, our top line will grow faster than we had expected, at least 4% organically. And remember, that's before the
addition of approximately $2.8 billion in revenue from the Danone biscuit acquisition.
In 2007, although pricing was higher than in the past, it represented less than one-third of our organic revenue growth. In  it's likely
that pricing will be a much more significant factor as we offset higher input costs. The investments we've made and will continue to make
are strengthening our brand equity and enabling improved pricing power.
As a result, we are far better able to recover input cost increases through pricing and productivity, however, we do expect that near-term
category volumes will be negatively impacted as consumers adjust to new price levels. Through it all, I remain confident that our
continued investments in marketing and innovation will drive further share gains across more of our portfolio, despite our pricing actions.
Now let's look at operating income. While Danone will have a modest dampening effect on margins in its first year, we expect that
operating income ex items will grow faster than revenue in 2008.
 
We also expect that Q4  represented the low point in our margins and they will progressively improve as  unfolds. We will
continue to invest in the next wave of trajectory changing initiatives and we'll further accelerate our advertising and consumer spending
toward our long-term target of  to 9% of revenue.
Turning to earnings per share. Ex items our EPS guidance is at least $1.90. This reflects a  point headwind to earnings growth from the
increase in our effective tax rate from 31.2% in  to 33.5% in  as we become a fully independent tax filer. If we were to normalize
for taxes, our EPS guidance would represent an increase of almost 8% year-over-year.
Turning to Slide 12. To summarize, we've had a solid start to our plan to restore Kraft to reliable growth.
We continue to invest in our growth initiatives. They're paying dividends and at the same time they're strengthening our brand equity and
pricing power in the face of unprecedented input costs.
We're successfully reducing costs and overheads to provide additional funding for investment and our strategic actions are strengthening
our portfolio and future growth prospects. I remain confident that by  we'll be well positioned to reliably deliver our long-term
targets of at least 4% organic net revenue growth and  to 9% EPS growth.
And now I'll turn the call over to Tim.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
Good morning, Eric.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
Well, Eric, I think as Tim said, we certainly expect to see input costs up at about the same rate as we saw in 2007. The reality, though, it'll
be a mirror image of what we saw in 2007, so the moderation comes from the fact that we'll be lapping the spike year ago but we do
expect to see input costs up at about the same rate. The good news, though, is that our brands are strengthening and we're able to
recover those input costs as a result.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
Good morning, Todd.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
Yes, Todd, I mean, we did go to market for about half of it late last year and we still have the other half of it to go but I can't talk
specifically about when and where.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
Tim, as you know, we laid out a restructuring plan in  that we then updated in 2006. We are finishing up that restructuring plan and
we expect to end that as we exist 2008. Our plans then as we go forward and we hit our stride in  will be to report on a GAAP basis
and we've made that commitment and we're underscoring it again today.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
First of all, David, I think the issue of recovering the input costs has everything to do with our brand equity and our pricing power. So
although we actually took some very significant actions on our cheese business, our pricing realization was not as strong as we'd like it to
be because we don't yet have suitable brand equity.
As I mentioned, we're starting to see some encouragement on our singles business as we have made some investments in base
marketing as well as in new products like Singles Select. But the key to our future in cheese, as it is in so many of our businesses, is
continuing to ensure that we have invested appropriately in quality, in marketing support and in innovation, to be able to realize those
price opportunities.
Having said that, I think if you look at our results for 2007, you can see that there's already more pricing power. We already have more
pricing power across the portfolio than we've had in quite some time and our plan in  is to be able to recover more of those costs.
But it has everything to do with our ability to build our brand equities and to build our innovation pipeline and we still have some work to
do on cheese but I think we are at least -- we've made a good start.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
Good morning, Jonathan.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
Jonathan, I think Tim's comment helps to understand the impact on the fourth quarter, which was simply that the curve stayed up and
we were priced to a lower level. And we did not react fast enough because historically we would have expected that curve to come down
in the back half of the year.
Going forward we will be pricing much more aggressively and we will in some cases be sacrificing, at least in the early months, as the
consumers adjust to new higher price points, we will sacrifice some volume. We believe, though, that it will be an industry phenomenon
and we will be able to continue to grow share in the face of those pricing actions.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
They're about where we'd like them to be. And, again, this is an industry phenomenon and we expect that all of the players in the
industry are dealing with the same challenges on input costs.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
As you'll see on the year, our aggregate spending hit about 6.9%. So we're making some good progress as we exited  and made the
necessary investments in our wave one initiatives.
As I mentioned in 2008, we are going to continue to make progress toward our longer-term target of  to 9% revenue and we expect that
the aggregate spending including Danone will be in the mid 7% range.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
Eric, we've got a whole host of manufacturing objectives and initiatives. Clearly, to the extent that we are expecting to see continued
record high input costs, and we are expecting that our pricing and productivity together will offset those, we have a whole host of
productivity initiatives designed to improve our performance. So I don't want to talk about any specific ones today but I assure you that
productivity is a critical piece of our program in  as it has been historically.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
We look at ROA, we look at OE, we look at a whole variety of other metrics but the end in mind is to lower our cost per pound on a
conversion basis year-over-year.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
Good morning, Terry.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
Terry, you know, I don't want to get into hypotheticals on our guidance. We're starting the second year of our three-year plan. If in fact we
start to see that the market reacts better than we expect to the pricing actions, we will continue to invest in our franchises.
So I hope the optimistic forecasts are accurate. I think we're planning prudently. But if in fact we do see some upside and in fact the
volume impact recovers, the volume recovers faster than anticipated, we will be able to continue to make some investments in our
franchises.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
David, I feel much better about our innovation pipeline today than I did a year ago. We're going to share a lot of -- give you a lot more
visibility of that at CAGNY.
But just a couple of the items that I talked about are not just new items that we launched in 2007, they're platforms. So Oreo Cakesters,
for example, is our entry into a $1 billion snack cake category. We've got a whole pipeline that comes behind that.
Ultimate Pizza is our entry into the upper mainstream pizza segment and you'll see some new items coming in there. LiveActive cheeses
is our entry into the $500 million pre and probiotic category. You'll see some additional items there.
So as you look across the portfolio, in addition to some of the actions we're taking on core businesses like our Maxwell House coffee,
100% Arabica product, as well as our pourables items, which have been significantly upgraded, I think you'll see a much more robust
pipeline than we had a year ago and that's what gives me the confidence that we can maintain our top line momentum even as we're
taking the pricing that we've indicated.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
Look, Andrew, I think there's no question that our pricing power has improved. If you look at the 5% revenue growth that we turned in in
2007, we've got  points of pricing in that growth together with  points of [all] mix which I think is a stronger performance than you've
seen from us in quite some time.
2008, we're going to get a lot closer to recovering input cost. Given the high levels, though, I'm not expecting we're going to go much
ahead of that. But I think as Tim said, particularly as we look at markets like dairy, we're looking to get much closer to the marketplace so
that we don't find ourselves caught behind.

You're welcome.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
Well, we're going to continue to make investment, Chris, in the developing markets. We've seen double-digit growth from that geography
and we expect that that will continue going forward.
As we look ahead, though, we will continue to take aggressive pricing actions as part of that so I think we will continue to see
improvement in our overall margins. There's, in some of our individual markets, there are some one-times in the base that might map
that a little bit but in aggregate, we are looking for improved margin expansion from our developing markets as we are from the EU.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
No, actually, I think it was just a mathematical impact and the fact that volumes started to become a bigger part of the equation. So I
think you're going to continue to see in 2008, as I mentioned, pricing will play a bigger part in our overall revenue growth and mix will
continue to be important.
As we look at the new items in our pipeline, they are generally higher margin than their base counterparts and we expect that trend to
continue, as well as the impact that we're seeing on our base business as we migrate some of our base products like Ultimate Pizza, like
Jacobs Symphony to the upper mainstream end.

6.9.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
Good morning, Pablo.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
Let me see if I can help you through that, Pablo. Our  marketing A&C investment was about 6.8% and we took it up to 6.9% so we
not only saw a  basis point increase but more importantly it was in the face of these unprecedented commodity costs. So I feel very
good about that.
As we enter 2008, as I mentioned, we're targeting to be more in the mid  range with the addition of Danone and we'll continue to be
making some investments but not quite at the same rate as we were making in the past.
 
The question with respect to margin expansion, let me see if I can help you through that. Clearly, our strategy is working and we will
continue to execute that strategy in 2008. We will see margin expansion, as Tim and I said, but it will not come quite as rapidly as we had
hoped because of the fact that higher costs are going to necessitate price increases and we will see some dampening impact in the
near-term on volume as the market adjusts.
The good news is we clearly are seeing brand strength, our brands strengthening as a result of the investments that we've made and so
we expect that over time we'll continue to be able to benefit, we will be able to benefit from the operating leverage that we laid out in our
growth algorithm.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
Pablo, there's no question that our EU margins need to expand and we're in the process of taking a number of actions there. We had a
very strong performance this past year on the top line in the EU after many years of decline and I think we've got our base business
moving in the right direction.
Our focus in  will be to begin to expand margins and we've got a number of initiatives in place to allow us to do that over the next
few years. So we're not satisfied with our margins in the EU, but again, I believe that the investments that we've made in our core brands
like Jacobs and like Milka will serve us well as we move forward and we start to recover more of the input costs.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
Actually, Robert, we're looking for margin expansion across the portfolio. As I mentioned before, the first half will be a little more
challenging because of the higher input costs relative to year-ago, but we expect to see margin expansion across the portfolio and
around the world.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
Well there's no question in the near-term, more of the profit growth will come from North America and, of course, that's almost 80% of
our portfolio so that makes you feel pretty good. In the EU, we will continue to build on our base momentum while we expand margins
and it will take us a little bit longer to get there.
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
Good morning.
 
 
Irene Rosenfeld Kraft Foods, Inc. - Chairman, CEO
It's actually very simple, Eric. While margins will be up, they'll be up a little less than they would have been our base business because of
the addition of Danone. They've got a very attractive margin.
 
But as you know, international margins are a little bit lower than the Kraft average so it's just simple math. But the net of it is that the
guidance that we've given you assumes margin expansion as a consequence of the pricing actions that we're taking together with our
productivity and our overhead leverage.
